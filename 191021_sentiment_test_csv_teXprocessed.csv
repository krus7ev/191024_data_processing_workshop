CROWN POINT, Ind. — A northwestern Indiana woman accused of driving over her boyfriend twice with a car has been charged in his killing.

Twenty-three-year-old Briana Rice of Hammond is charged with murder, voluntary manslaughter and leaving the scene of a fatal accident, in the April 24 death of 25-year-old Terrondy Jones.

She appeared for an initial hearing Monday in Lake County during which a judge entered a not guilty plea on her behalf.

The Post-Tribune reports  that a witness told police she saw a couple arguing outside an East Chicago apartment before a man began walking away from a car. The witness said a woman driver then ran over the man twice before driving away from the scene.

Online court documents do not list the name of Rice’s court-appointed attorney.","__label__Neutral"
1051,"Stop Appeasing the Democrats","Front Page ^ | September 25, 2018  | Bruce Thornton
From the playground to geopolitics, appeasing an aggressor invites only more aggression. This timeless truth of human nature is one that we moderns cant seem to accept. We reflexively assume that a rational accommodation or concessions will be reciprocated by those proven to be ready to use any means necessary to achieve their aims, no matter how amoral, unfair, or vicious. Brett Kavanaughs confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court illustrate that this false assumption leads only to more demands, and ultimately to defeat.
The last-minute accusations from Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who claims that decades ago Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a frat party at Yale, are transparent acts of aggression against the judge and Republicans, one engineered by the Democrats.
Senator Dianne Feinstein sat for months on Fords letter and thenjust as the Dems did in 1991with Anita Hills charges of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomass during his hearingsreleased it only when Kavanaugh appeared to be heading for confirmation. Feinstein still hasnt given the Judiciary Committee an unredacted copy of the letter. A few weeks after Ford went public, and after Kavanaugh said he had dairies from that summer detailing his whereabouts, The New Yorker published Ramirezs account of a drunken party filled with obscene drinking games where he exposed himself to Ramirez.","__label__Neutral"

2580,"Pacific language weeks celebrate national asset","The 2019 Pacific Language Weeks will boost awareness of the value of New Zealand’s Pacific languages both within Pacific communities and beyond.
“It will be a particularly momentous year for languages because the United Nations has declared this year as the International Year of Indigenous Languages with the aim of raising awareness of the consequences of the endangerment of indigenous languages across the world,” says Minister for Pacific Peoples, Aupito William Sio.
“It is an exciting time for everyone because indigenous languages are being recognised internationally as important for development, reconciliation, good governance, peace building and lifting people’s general wellbeing.
“That’s why it is so important that we protect and nurture Pacific languages in Aotearoa both for the wellbeing of our Pacific peoples and the broader community. These languages are a national asset. They add a unique vibrancy to our national life.
The importance of strengthening and broadening the use of Pacific languages was a consistent theme at the recent Pacific Aotearoa Summit, held in November last year.
“It’s a concern voiced by young and old alike. Our languages are a key part of our individual and community wellbeing. We thrive when we hear our own stories, in our own languages, from our own people.
The 2013 census confirmed that language use had declined across all Pacific language groups. The languages of New Zealand’s realm countries: Niue, Tokelau and the Cook Islands are classified by UNESCO as vulnerable or endangered. Almost 60% of Pacific people are now born in New Zealand and there is concern that the trend will accelerate unless promotion of the languages is strengthened.
“To reverse this trend, we need to promote our languages not just amongst Pacific communities but more widely. They need to be recognised and valued in our schools and workplaces, in all walks of life. That’s what these language weeks are all about and I applaud the enormous effort our communities put in each year. Without this huge volunteer effort they simply wouldn’t be possible.
“I hope making the dates of these language weeks available early, will encourage more groups and organisations to get involved in the promotion of the Pacific Language Weeks this year,” says Aupito William Sio.
The Pacific Language Weeks first started with Samoa in 2007 and have since been able to build up to include celebrating, promoting and raising awareness of seven of our Pacific Languages.
The 2019 Language Week line-up begins with Samoa Language Week in May and ends with Tokelau Language Week in October. Although officially termed Language Weeks, all run for at least a month and some extend activities throughout the year.

2371,"Miley Cyrus’ Brother Trace Reveals If She & Liam Hemsworth Are Planning To Have Kids Soon - Hollywood Life","Miley Cyrus’ brother Trace told HL EXCLUSIVELY about whether Miley &amp; Liam Hemsworth are trying to have a child soon!

Miley Cyrus, 26, and Liam Hemsworth, 29, may be in complete wedded bliss, but adding a baby to their family is not something they’re planning in the near future. During HollywoodLife‘s EXCLUSIVE interview at The Barbershop Cuts and Cocktails’ opening at the Cosmopolitan Hotel with Miley’s brother Trace Cyrus, who is gearing up for his Vegas DJ residency at the Barbershop while Brandi Cyrus prepares for her residency at APEX, and his fiance Taylor Sanders, we asked the pair if they thought Miley would have kids soon. “No,” Trace replied. Taylor added, “She has no desire. I think she has so much ambition to do so much more in her career even though she’s done so much. It’s just not the time for her.”

“She has so much time to decide that. She hasn’t even hit her dirty 30 yet,” Trace went on to say. “She’s good.” Taylor continued, “We talked. We’re next for the kids.” Miley, who married Liam on Dec. 24, 2018, talked about how her marriage doesn’t affect the fact that she still identifies as queer . “[B]ut, I think the reason we got married isn’t old-fashioned,” she told  Vanity Fair ’s Zach Baron. “I actually think it’s kind of New Age. We’re redefining, to be f***ing frank, what it looks like for someone that’s a queer person like myself to be in a hetero relationship.”

Miley recently opened up on the RuPaul: What’s the Tea with Michelle Visage podcast about how her first kiss was with a girl back in middle school . “When I was a kid growing up, being from the South, and my first experience, my first kiss was with a girl in middle school,” Cyrus revealed. “And no one could understand, in Nashville, saying that.”","__label__Neutral"
2146,"In what is apparently not an April Fools’ joke, Impossible Foods and Burger King are launching an Impossible Whopper - TechCrunch","In what is apparently not an April Fools’ joke, Impossible Foods and Burger King are launching an Impossible Whopper

The meat substitute manufacturer Impossible Foods and fast food giant Burger King are launching an Impossible Whopper.

According to a report in The New York Times, Burger King is launching the Impossible Whopper in stores in the St. Louis area with plans for a broader rollout later — and not as part of some elaborate April Fools’ day prank.

Burger King isn’t the first fast food chain to bring an Impossible burger to market. That’d be White Castle , which is selling Impossible sliders at stores in the Northeast.

But Burger King would certainly be the biggest slinger of ground beef to go with a meatless patty maker.

Impossible’s largest competition in the meat-substitute market, the publicly traded purveyor of purely beef free patties, Beyond Meat, has a similar deal with Carl’s Jr. for its own version of a beef-less burger.

The Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods has been on a roll. They introduced a new version of their burger to much fanfare at the Consumer Electronics Show earlier this year, and have been locking in deals with higher-end fast casual restaurants and now large international fast food chains.

In the eight years since the company raised its first $7 million investment from Khosla Ventures, Impossible Foods has managed to amass over $389 million in financing — including a convertible note last year from the Singaporean global investment powerhouse Temasek (which is backed by the Singaporean government) and the Chinese investment fund Sailing Capital (a state-owned investment fund backed by the Communist Party-owned Chinese financial services firm, Shanghai International Group).

It remains to be seen if this is a harbinger of things to come for Burger King and whether the fast food giant will embrace other alternative meat companies like the providers of fake chicken or cellular based meat substitutes like Memphis Meats.","__label__Neutral"

618,"White House: Trump meets with German auto executives","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump met Tuesday with executives from three big German automakers amid U.S.-European trade tensions focused on car exports and the threat of tariffs.

Executives from BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen were invited to participate in a series of meetings with Trump’s top economic advisers to discuss investment opportunities in the United States, including in manufacturing and research and development, the White House said.

Trump, however, has threatened to slap tariffs on auto imports from Europe and other countries, citing U.S. trade deficits with those nations. Trump is relying on tariffs, and the threat of imposing them, to force other countries to buy more goods from America.

“I am a Tariff Man,” the president said Tuesday in one of a series of tweets about a new round of trade talks with China after the world’s two largest economies imposed tit-for-tat tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of each other’s goods after Trump struck first.

“When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN.”

Trump had threatened to tax imported cars, trucks and auto parts, potentially targeting imports that last year totalled $335 billion, and the European Union had warned that it would retaliate with tariffs on products worth $20 billion if Trump put duties on cars and auto parts from Europe.

But Trump and European leaders stepped back from the brink of a trade war over autos during the summer, agreeing to open talks to tear down trade barriers between the United States and the EU.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow and other administration officials were to participate in Tuesday’s meetings.

The White House had no other comment on Trump’s participation.

Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said administration officials want to talk to the German car makers “about a lot of things.”

“I don’t think this meeting or anything else for that matter, right now, is moving toward car tariffs,” Kudlow told reporters Monday. “The president has said it’s in his quiver of arrows, sure, but none of that’s changed.”

In Berlin on Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel also tried to tamp down speculation about tariffs, dismissing suggestions that the automakers could even conduct trade diplomacy. Merkel stressed that trade negotiations are the responsibility of the EU.","__label__Neutral"

647,"Former Texans cornerback visits the Jets","The Jets are not waiting for free agency to start to begin trying to upgrade their roster.

Free agent cornerback Kevin Johnson visited the Jets on Saturday, according to a source. The Texans cut Johnson this week, making him available to sign immediately and not have to wait until free agency starts next week.

Johnson was a first-round pick by Houston in 2015, taken 16th overall out of Wake Forest. His career has been plagued by injuries, though, and the Texans cut him rather than pay him the $9 million his contract called for in 2019.

Johnson, 26, has one interception in four seasons. He has only played 16 games once and only played 19 out of 48 games in the past three seasons. Last year, he played just one game as he dealt with multiple concussions.

If the Jets chose to sign Johnson, he would be a depth player at a position where the Jets need help. Morris Claiborne, Buster Skrine and Darryl Roberts are all scheduled to be free agents.

Johnson has also visited the Browns and the Bills, according to reports.","__label__Neutral"
556,"Cardi B Blasts The Shade Room For Fueling Drama Between Artists [Video]","More and more celebrities seem to be speaking out against The Shade Room as of late, Cardi B being one of them. Taking to Instagram, the “Clout” rapper had a lot to say about the mass media platform, insisting that it “fuels drama” between artists and more.

“This Water buffalo built b*tch, f*cking Angie, the owner of The Shade Room… because she knows that she’s not allowed to post me, so what does she do? She posts mad sh*t of people that she knows that I’m associated with,” Cardi claims.

“Everybody that they know that I’m cool with, they always try to get them set up for people to talk sh*t,” she goes on. “Offset donated $25,000 to the Ellen foundation for the kids in Africa. Did The Shade Room post it? No… have they posted any positive sh*t and investment talk that he’s been talking about in his interviews? No! But they sure posted the way he had drama with his baby mom. They sure posted about his court cases, right?”

Cardi continued by stating there seems to be a “hate campaign” against Quality Control . “That sh*t is getting wack!” she said “It’s trash… how do people want us to change? For what? Why change if y’all only post the f*ck sh*t that happens in our f*cking lives? Y’all don’t post the change, y’all don’t post the good, y’all don’t post the accomplishments. Y’all post the f*ck sh*t.”

She then went into discussing R. Kelly and Michael Jackson constantly going viral for alleged pedophilia. Responding to people who ask why are there documentaries about these artists, she said “Let me tell y’all why…because y’all make people feel like it’s OK to do so. Why wouldn’t a white caucasian person try to capitalize off the drama that happens in the urban, in the black entertainment business when Black-owned blogs capitalize off their own drama and problems? You don’t see Donald Trump, you don’t see Charlie Sheen sh*t going viral every year,” she adds.

The new mom ended her statements by saying that Black blogs capitalize off of Black drama , causing white publications to do the same. “Stop claiming that y’all for the people, when y’all fuel drama in between these artists,” she added.

Watch portions of what she had to say up top and see that part about R. Kelly and Michael Jackson here . Do you agree with all of her comments? It’s worth mentioning that Surviving R. Kelly was largely the work of dream hampton, a Black woman… and also, Donald Trump is literally always going viral for the f*ck sh*t he does — literally, every other day.

2353,"How Twitter vaulted &#x27;Abolish ICE&#x27; into the mainstream","Calls to ""Abolish ICE"" began as an obscure Twitter hashtag created by liberal activists. It's now a movement supported by prominent progressive leaders and candidates in races across the country and the center of a heated debate in Democratic circles.

The viral campaign pushing for the elimination of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is the latest example of how Twitter has become a tool for groups outside the mainstream to get their ideas in front of power brokers.

Writer and activist Sean McElwee, who is credited with creating the #AbolishICE hashtag, told The Hill that Twitter's platform and its reach created a unique opportunity to spread the idea.

It is generally true that having a strong presence on Twitter will give it legs in the real world because people who influence real-world stuff are on Twitter, he said.

McElwee first tweeted it in February 2017 and keep advocating ending the agency to his over 70,000 followers.

The hashtag eventually caught on in far-left Twitter circles in memes, with Twitter users incorporating ""Abolish ICE"" into their display names and in other ways.

Social media watchers say the first breakthrough was when a prominent Democratic candidate, Randy Bryce, who is running for the seat held by outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), offered his support for abolishing ICE in April of 2018.

Ana Maria Archilla the co-executive director of Center for Popular Democracy, said that at first progressives ""were worried about the political implications.""

But ""when Randy could say it in rural Wisconsin, in Paul Ryan, territory, she continued, activists felt they had made a breakthrough.

Bryce said the position always made sense to him after seeing what rural migrant workers in his state dealt with from the agency.

Even before I started running for office it was something that I had noticed in the immigrant community  that people had this really negative image of ICE, he told The Hill.

The biggest moment for the Abolish ICE movement though came after Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist, upset Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), in a primary. As she leapt into the spotlight, she brought the calls to abolish ICE, into the national debate.

Within days of her victory, abolishing ICE had become a litmus test for Democrats running in the midterms and for those seen as potential 2020 presidential contenders.

For all the success #AbolishICE enjoyed on social media, McElwee said that equally crucial were organizing efforts by activists.

If you came up with a new phrase like ""Let dolphins vote' and a million people supported it, there wouldnt be an intellectual case for it and an organizing apparatus behind it, he explained.

The reason people could say Abolish ICE and it the hit the ground running is because it was already resting on a ton of intellectual work and organizing and movement building that had already been going on, Archilla told The Hill. ""The demand is as old as ICE.

She said immigration groups had long been frustrated with ICE. But in the Obama years, mainstream immigration groups shied away from calls to abolish any agencies, instead believing that they would be able to push immigration reform through Congress.

We thought legalization was in our reach. We thought we could win it under Bush, then under Obama, then we realized we couldnt because of the realities of Congress, Archilla said. Then we came to see that we should go after the rules around migration and enforcement.

Archila said that groups assumed it would take a long time before their position became politically acceptable.

But then surprisingly the #AbolishICE hashtag went viral on Twitter boosted in part by the Trump administration's controversial zero-tolerance policy that led to migrant children being separated from parents caught crossing the southern border.

That policy sparked a firestorm with the administration receiving criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Democratic lawmakers also began rallying behind the idea of abolishing ICE.

Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), a potential 2020 contender, became the first senator to call for scrapping the agency. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) even introduced legislation in Congress to eliminate the agency.

The hashtag also gave the public a way to easily weigh in on the issue.

It was in the context of Trump and the escalation of attacks on immigrants ... he lifted the veil, Archila said. When people saw that and were confronted with the reality of immigrants  people see that and said that cant possibly be who we are. It was in that context that [demands to] Abolish ICE ... became the most succinct way of saying, we do not want our country to be that.

Garrett Broad, a professor at Fordham University who has researched social media and activist movements, said that Abolish ICEs efforts come from a tried and true activist playbook.

This is a strategy in social movements where you play the flank, Broad said.

Activists, though, can now speed up that process, thanks to social media, in particular Twitter.

McElwee appears to be well aware of this  his previous Twitter display name was Overton Window mover, a term that describes how to change the boundaries of what is considered acceptable mainstream political discourse.

Broad said that unlike prior fringe ideas, Twitter supercharged the pace at which a trendy leftist hashtag could drive the national political discussion.

But Democratic leaders were always wary of the idea, especially in a midterm year. And many prominent Dems worried that the calls to abolish ICE diverted attention from what they saw as the real issue: Changing the country's immigration laws.

Republicans also saw political advantage in the debate over ICE. Trump slammed Democrats for calls to abolish ICE earlier this month, saying they were ""demeaning"" the agency's workers and citing the threat from gangs such as MS-13.

House GOP leaders also pushed ahead with a vote on a measure offering support for ICE in hopes of publicly stoking Dem divisions. That measure passed the House earlier this month in a 244-35. Eighteen Democrats voted to back ICE and 34 opposed the resolution, which for procedural reasons needed two-thirds to pass.

Some advocates say that the effort to abolish ICE has lost some momentum. They say there are limits to how quickly they can change the national discourse even with a social media wave.

In some ways what the phrase abolish ICE fails to do is to make that bigger connection, said Silky Shah, executive director of the Detention Watch network, a pro-immigrant rights group, which backs scraping the agency.

Shah likened ""Abolish ICE"" to another hashtag turned rallying cry, ""Black Lives Matter.""

Black Lives Matter is saying, its important we as a movement are fighting for black lives. I could see connections but in ways, the phrase abolish ICE alone isnt enough, she said.

McElwee, though, said there had been important gains in the fight against ICE and its policies. He likened what the left had done to ICE with how Republicans were able to direct conservative ire at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

That was a very concrete win for the Republican party. By making Republicans hate the IRS, it makes it very hard for it to do its job, he said.

""Every agency has political capital and the fact that ICE has lost a lot of its, has been a huge win.

2638,"The first FDA-approved device to treat ADHD, explained - CNET","The first FDA-approved device to treat ADHD, explained
Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have a new, nondrug treatment option for managing the condition.
For decades, managing ADHD has meant getting a prescription for Adderall or Ritalin. Now children have another option: the Monarch external Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation (eTNS ) system, an ADHD treatment device that works by sending mild electrical stimulation shocks to the nervous system. 
The Food and Drug Administration gave the device clearance to be marketed as a treatment for patients between 7 and 12 years old. Here's what you need to know about the Monarch eTNS.
First, what is ADHD and how is it diagnosed?
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a common condition that begins in childhood and is often difficult to manage. Symptoms include inattention, difficulty focusing, impulsivity and high levels of activity.
To be diagnosed with ADHD, a person must exhibit persistent inattention and hyperactivity that's long-lasting and interferes with important parts of life. An example of inattention is failing to pay attention to details on school assignments, while examples of hyperactivity include fidgeting, blurting out or excessive speech and spontaneous bouts of movement, such as jumping or running. 
Additionally, several symptoms must have been present before age 12, and several symptoms must be present in more than one location. For example, a child might exhibit inattention and hyperactivity at school and in the car. 
What's the Monarch eTNS system?
The Monarch eTNS is a newly released medical device that attaches to the forehead via a patch and small wire. It sits just above the eyebrows and delivers a slight tingling sensation on the skin, an effect of the low-level nerve stimulation.
The Monarch system comes from California-based life sciences company NeuroSigma , which develops treatments and devices for neurological disorders.
How does the Monarch eTNS work?
The electric pulses from this cell phone-size device interact with the trigeminal nerve, which then sends therapeutic signals to the parts of the brain thought to be responsible for ADHD symptoms.
""This new device offers a safe, nondrug option for treatment of ADHD in pediatric patients through the use of mild nerve stimulation, a first of its kind,"" Carlos Pena, director of the FDA's Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices, said in a statement .
The FDA approved Monarch eTNS for use in managing ADHD symptoms after reviewing a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of 62 children with moderate-to-severe ADHD. Details of the trial were  published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in January. In the study, 32 children with ADHD used the Monarch eTNS device every night, and 30 children with ADHD used a placebo device.
The children who used the real device over the four-week trial period exhibited a greater reduction in their symptoms than the children who used the placebo.
What are the side effects and is it safe to use?
According to the 2019 study's authors, a big advantage of the Monarch eTNS system is the apparent lack of any serious health risks. The study notes that side effects include drowsiness, an increase in appetite, trouble sleeping, fatigue, headaches and teeth-clenching.
Even though it's marketed as extremely safe, Monarch eTNS is intended for use only under the supervision of a caretaker. Also, treatment with the Monarch system takes about a month before symptoms visibly improve. It's recommended that children who use Monarch eTNS check in with their doctor after four weeks to evaluate treatment effects.
Children who use the following shouldn't use Monarch eTNS:
A pacemaker or other implanted device.
An insulin pump or other body-worn medical device.
Prescription ADHD medications such as Adderall or Ritalin.
How can I get the Monarch eTNS?
Monarch eTNS is already available in Canada, Australia and Europe as a treatment for epilepsy and depression. There's no US release date yet.
Monarch eTNS is available only with a prescription, which first requires an ADHD diagnosis.
Additionally, children can use Monarch eTNS only if they aren't currently using a prescription medication to manage ADHD symptoms. It's also recommended that children with pacemakers, insulin pumps or other bodily devices don't use the Monarch system.
What does this mean for future ADHD treatments?
The marketing approval of the Monarch eTNS from the FDA sets a precedent for similar devices to follow.
""This action creates a new regulatory classification, which means that subsequent devices of the same type with the same intended use may go through the FDA's 510(k) premarket process, whereby devices can obtain marketing authorization by demonstrating substantial equivalence to a predicate device,"" the FDA wrote in its statement.
This precedent will allow similar devices to move through the FDA's approval process much faster.

A recent heartfelt telephone conversation with a British Jewish friend of mine proved utterly depressing. Yet again he expressed the very real fears felt by the British Jewish community in the event that Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn ever becomes prime minister.
Corbyn has seen a number of his MP’s resign in recent weeks, primarily as a protest against his failure to address anti-Semitic abuse directed at them, and hate-filled campaigns against Zionism and the State of Israel. But the likely next British leader, a man with a track record of pro-Hezbollah, pro-Hamas, and anti-Israel rhetoric, has done little, if anything of substance to remedy the situation.
While the 0.3% of the British population that is Jewish might be genuinely concerned about Corbyn’s views on the subject, for the vast majority of the remaining 99.7% of the British public it isn’t an issue even close to the top of their priority list. The shambles that is Brexit, health and educations services, immigration, and infrastructure are, for them, far more pressing issues.
British Jews, once nonchalant in their belief that Britain was a genuine safe haven, are becoming increasingly concerned. A growing minority are convinced that there may come a time, in the not-too-distant future, when they have to up and leave.
Israel, of course, has for the last 70 years been considered the undoubted first point of refuge. However, it appears that it is with growing dismay that many British Jews whose politics are moderate and whose religious observance is anything but extreme, view with horror the prospect of a Benjamin Netanyahu-led government that includes members of the extremist, far-right and settler parties. Many are appalled by those who sympathize, and in some cases are adoring of the late-Meir Kahane, whose Kach party was outlawed in Israel due to its brazen, racist ideology.
In his efforts to cling on to power at all costs and sustain the cult that is ‘Bibi’, Netanyahu may well have placed a major barrier in the path of those who wouldn’t otherwise have thought twice about moving to live in Israel in the event that the situation in Britain, France, or elsewhere across Europe and beyond becomes untenable.
“If he thinks we’re going to rush over there and become part of [that project], he’s going to have to think again,” my friend lamented. “That would be like jumping out of the frying pan straight back into the fire!”
This from someone who, until last month, had invariably supported Netanyahu and argued that he is nothing less than the savior of the Jewish people.
Even the shot across Bibi’s bow fired by AIPAC in response to his alliance seems not to have shaken the PM’s resolve to form a far-right block regardless of the incendiary politics within it. But when power is a drug to which you have become hopelessly addicted, and like the worse addicts your sense of reality and decency evaporates, you’ll ally yourself with the worst people and sell even your beloved grandmother if it yields one more fix.
Facing up to the two-pronged prospect of genuine political rivals and the equally genuine threat of criminal indictment, the desperation that permeates every pore of the man who sees himself as the only person who can possibly govern this land is plain to see. His alliance with the Kahana-inspired Otzma Yehudit party should ring massive alarm bells in the mind of decent Likud supporters.
Worryingly, Netanyahu’s new political love-in might prove one step too far for some Diaspora Jews who have treasured the insurance policy of being able to come to this land.
As was so brutally demonstrated earlier today with yet another Palestinian terror attack on Israel, the last thing this country and international Jewry needs going forward is an even more fractured society when faced with so many external dangers.
This far-from-perfect but once vibrant, tolerant democracy, a democracy that broadly respected the rights of all its citizens regardless of race, color or creed, has for so long been a place of which the vast majority of Jews of all political opinions felt proud; one they would be happy to call “home”.
Now, in the event that anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism, or anti-Israel sentiments in the UK or anywhere else become an unbearable everyday reality, it may transpire that an increasing number will have no wish to become part of a far-right project laden with card-carrying racists, and may reluctantly feel they have no alternative but to look elsewhere?

2060,"66-Million-Year-Old Deathbed Linked to Dinosaur-Killing Meteor","University of California - Berkeley | Phys.org - March 29, 2019

The beginning of the end started with violent shaking that raised giant waves in the waters of an inland sea in what is now North Dakota.

Then, tiny glass beads began to fall like birdshot from the heavens. The rain of glass was so heavy it may have set fire to much of the vegetation on land. In the water, fish struggled to breathe as the beads clogged their gills.

The heaving sea turned into a 30-foot wall of water when it reached the mouth of a river, tossing hundreds, if not thousands, of fresh-water fish—sturgeon and paddlefish—onto a sand bar and temporarily reversing the flow of the river. Stranded by the receding water, the fish were pelted by glass beads up to 5 millimeters in diameter, some burying themselves inches deep in the mud. The torrent of rocks, like fine sand, and small glass beads continued for another 10 to 20 minutes before a second large wave inundated the shore and covered the fish with gravel, sand and fine sediment, sealing them from the world for 66 million years.

This unique, fossilized graveyard—fish stacked one atop another and mixed in with burned tree trunks, conifer branches, dead mammals, mosasaur bones, insects, the partial carcass of a Triceratops, marine microorganisms called dinoflagellates and snail-like marine cephalopods called ammonites—was unearthed by paleontologist Robert DePalma over the past six years in the Hell Creek Formation, not far from Bowman, North Dakota. The evidence confirms a suspicion that nagged at DePalma in his first digging season during the summer of 2013—that this was a killing field laid down soon after the asteroid impact that eventually led to the extinction of all ground-dwelling dinosaurs. The impact at the end of the Cretaceous Period, the so-called K-T boundary, exterminated 75 percent of life on Earth.

“This is the first mass death assemblage of large organisms anyone has found associated with the K-T boundary,” said DePalma, curator of paleontology at the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History in Florida and a doctoral student at the University of Kansas. “At no other K-T boundary section on Earth can you find such a collection consisting of a large number of species representing different ages of organisms and different stages of life, all of which died at the same time, on the same day.”

In a paper to appear next week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he and his American and European colleagues, including two University of California, Berkeley, geologists, describe the site, dubbed Tanis, and the evidence connecting it with the asteroid or comet strike off Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula 66 million years ago. That impact created a huge crater, called Chicxulub, in the ocean floor and sent vaporized rock and cubic miles of asteroid dust into the atmosphere. The cloud eventually enveloped Earth, setting the stage for Earth’s last mass extinction.

“It’s like a museum of the end of the Cretaceous in a layer a meter-and-a-half thick,” said Mark Richards, a UC Berkeley professor emeritus of earth and planetary science who is now provost and professor of earth and space sciences at the University of Washington.

Richards and Walter Alvarez, a UC Berkeley Professor of the Graduate School who 40 years ago first hypothesized that a comet or asteroid impact caused the mass extinction, were called in by DePalma and Dutch scientist Jan Smit to consult on the rain of glass beads and the tsunami-like waves that buried and preserved the fish. The beads, called tektites, formed in the atmosphere from rock melted by the impact.

Alex Jones reveals what globalists are actively fighting to deny from humanity.

Richards and Alvarez determined that the fish could not have been stranded and then buried by a typical tsunami, a single wave that would have reached this previously unknown arm of the Western Interior Seaway no less than 10 to 12 hours after the impact 3,000 kilometers away, if it didn’t peter out before then. Their reasoning: The tektites would have rained down within 45 minutes to an hour of the impact, unable to create mudholes if the seabed had not already been exposed.

Instead, they argue, seismic waves likely arrived within 10 minutes of the impact from what would have been the equivalent of a magnitude 10 or 11 earthquake, creating a seiche (pronounced saysh), a standing wave, in the inland sea that is similar to water sloshing in a bathtub during an earthquake. Though large earthquakes often generate seiches in enclosed bodies of water, they’re seldom noticed, Richards said. The 2011 Tohoku quake in Japan, a magnitude 9.0, created six-foot-high seiches 30 minutes later in a Norwegian fjord 8,000 kilometers away.

“The seismic waves start arising within nine to 10 minutes of the impact, so they had a chance to get the water sloshing before all the spherules (small spheres) had fallen out of the sky,” Richards said. “These spherules coming in cratered the surface, making funnels—you can see the deformed layers in what used to be soft mud—and then rubble covered the spherules. No one has seen these funnels before.”

The tektites would have come in on a ballistic trajectory from space, reaching terminal velocities of between 100 and 200 miles per hour, according to Alvarez, who estimated their travel time decades ago.

“You can imagine standing there being pelted by these glass spherules. They could have killed you,” Richards said. Many believe that the rain of debris was so intense that the energy ignited wildfires over the entire American continent, if not around the world.

“Tsunamis from the Chicxulub impact are certainly well-documented, but no one knew how far something like that would go into an inland sea,” DePalma said. “When Mark came aboard, he discovered a remarkable artifact—that the incoming seismic waves from the impact site would have arrived at just about the same time as the atmospheric travel time of the ejecta. That was our big breakthrough.”

At least two huge seiches inundated the land, perhaps 20 minutes apart, leaving six feet of deposits covering the fossils. Overlaying this is a layer of clay rich in iridium, a metal rare on Earth, but common in asteroids and comets. This layer is known as the K-T, or K-Pg boundary, marking the end of the Cretaceous Period and the beginning of the Tertiary Period, or Paleogene.

In 1979, Alvarez and his father, Nobelist Luis Alvarez of UC Berkeley, were the first to recognize the significance of iridium that is found in 66 million-year-old rock layers around the world. They proposed that a comet or asteroid impact was responsible for both the iridium at the K-T boundary and the mass extinction.

The impact would have melted the bedrock under the seafloor and pulverized the asteroid, sending dust and melted rock into the stratosphere, where winds would have carried them around the planet and blotted out the sun for months, if not years. Debris would have rained down from the sky: not only tektites, but also rock debris from the continental crust, including shocked quartz, whose crystal structure was deformed by the impact.

The iridium-rich dust from the pulverized meteor would have been the last to fall out of the atmosphere after the impact, capping off the Cretaceous.

“When we proposed the impact hypothesis to explain the great extinction, it was based just on finding an anomalous concentration of iridium—the fingerprint of an asteroid or comet,” said Alvarez. “Since then, the evidence has gradually built up. But it never crossed my mind that we would find a deathbed like this.”

Key confirmation of the meteor hypothesis was the discovery of a buried impact crater, Chicxulub, in the Caribbean and off the coast of the Yucatan in Mexico, that was dated to exactly the age of the extinction. Shocked quartz and glass spherules were also found in K-Pg layers worldwide. The new discovery at Tanis is the first time the debris produced in the impact was found along with animals killed in the immediate aftermath of the impact.

“And now we have this magnificent and completely unexpected site that Robert DePalma is excavating in North Dakota, which is so rich in detailed information about what happened as a result of the impact,” Alvarez said. “For me, it is very exciting and gratifying!”

Jan Smit, a retired professor of sedimentary geology from Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam in The Netherlands who is considered the world expert on tektites from the impact, joined DePalma to analyze and date the tektites from the Tanis site. Many were found in near perfect condition embedded in amber, which at the time was pliable pine pitch.

“I went to the site in 2015 and, in front of my eyes, he (DePalma) uncovered a charred log or tree trunk about four meters long which was covered in amber, which acted as sort of an aerogel and caught the tektites when they were coming down,” Smit said. “It was a major discovery, because the resin, the amber, covered the tektites completely, and they are the most unaltered tektites I have seen so far, not 1 percent of alteration. We dated them, and they came out to be exactly from the K-T boundary.”

The tektites in the fishes’ gills are also a first.

“Paddlefish swim through the water with their mouths open, gaping, and in this net, they catch tiny particles, food particles, in their gill rakers, and then they swallow, like a whale shark or a baleen whale,” Smit said. “They also caught tektites. That by itself is an amazing fact. That means that the first direct victims of the impact are these accumulations of fishes.”

Smit also noted that the buried body of a Triceratops and a duck-billed hadrosaur proves beyond a doubt that dinosaurs were still alive at the time of the impact.

“We have an amazing array of discoveries which will prove in the future to be even more valuable,” Smit said. “We have fantastic deposits that need to be studied from all different viewpoints. And I think we can unravel the sequence of incoming ejecta from the Chicxulub impact in great detail, which we would never have been able to do with all the other deposits around the Gulf of Mexico.”

“So far, we have gone 40 years before something like this turned up that may very well be unique,” Smit said. “So, we have to be very careful with that place, how we dig it up and learn from it. This is a great gift at the end of my career. Walter sees it as the same.”

The opinions, facts and any media content in them are presented solely by the authors, and neither The Times of Israel nor its partners assume any responsibility for them. Please contact us in case of abuse. In case of abuse,

The seder as we know it is actually the outline that our sages created for what was to take place on seder night.  Rather than simply read the outline, as many us do, we were to fill it with discussion, debate and commentary.  For many years I (and many others) have published supplements to the Haggadah designed to help us do what our rabbis had intended.  Here is the English version of the supplement that I and ‘Torat Tzedek-Torah of Justice” have created for this year.

WHO SITS WITH US AT OUR SEDER?

Eloheinu v’Elohei Kadmoneinu (Avoteinu, Avoteinu vEmoteinu), our God &amp; God of our ancestors, we are gathered around this seder table as b’nei khorin, free people commanded to remember our dark nights of oppression. Your Torah warns us never to become oppressors ourselves, reminding us, “For you were strangers in the land of Egypt.” Yet, when we’re honest with ourselves, we know that we have been Pharaoh to other peoples, and to the disadvantaged among our own people. Our awareness that, “In every generation there are those who arise to destroy us” often causes us to harden our hearts, perceive hatred where it does not exist and justify the oppression of others.

We therefore turn to You, as in days of old. Stand with us, so that our fears not rise up to be our taskmasters. Help us to banish Pharaoh from our hearts, and let the rest of humanity in.

With Pharaoh at bay, we are better able to perceive the desecration of Your Image found in every human being. As with the plagues of old, our joy is diminished when we hear of those whose lives remain embittered. “Hashata Avdei,” “This year we remain slaves because of their oppression.” We remove additional drops of wine from our cup of celebration and renew our commitment to winning their freedom, thereby completing ours. We make room in our hearts and at our table for:

(Choose one or more. One person can read out loud, &amp; all participants can read the final line together)

Ibrahim {not real name) organized the Bedouin shepherds around the “Omer’s Farm” outpost. He always had a smile on his face, and would even flirt with the women soldiers.  One day Omer’s brother and two additional thugs beat him up.  The army managed to arrive and recover his stolen sheep and donkey.   He declined to lodge a police complaint, fearing what would happen if Omer would decide to take revenge. A month later soldiers detained him.  Knowing that Omer didn’t want to see uppity shepherds in the area he had claimed as his, the soldiers targeted the leader. Shortly after, Ibrahim says that Omer showed up in his home in the middle of the night, put a gun to his head, and told him that he would kill all his sheep if he dared to come into “his” territory again. Ibrahim’s father made him sell his sheep the next day.   More recently, masked soldiers “visited” Ibrahim’s neighbors, warning them not to enter “Omer’s territory.”

Tonight, when we open the door for Elijah we remember the years that we didn’t know who or what was waiting for us in the middle of the night.  We know we must do what we can to stop the terror stalking Ibrahim and the Bedouin shepherds by night, and the expulsions from grazing lands by day. Omer doesn’t want them anywhere near his table, but they have a seat at ours.

Sima (not real name) is an Israeli single parent mom.  She lives on the edge, and suffered for months because she couldn’t afford a dentist.  She met somebody in the tents of the 2011 social protest movement, but can’t marry because she might lose the public housing apartment she fought for.  Sima doesn’t just fight for herself. She runs a legal clinic that has helped many to put a roof over their heads.  The clerks and bureaucrats know that when she accompanies another single mother, they can’t play around.

The midrash teaches that we were redeemed from Egypt because the women maintained hope and persevered, even when the men had given up.  Tonight we invite Sima to our table. We honor her tenacity, and the perseverance of the single parent moms for whom a laden table is a far away dream.

Ali (not real name) used to make a living from his olive trees. But his bad luck is that his grove is next to the violent Khavat Gilad outpost.  He once had 450 trees there, but only 230 remain.  He can’t get to the grove without army protection, and when he does get there he finds every year that most of his olives have been stolen. Khavat Gilad homes have been built in the grove.  Now in his sixties, he has been forced to become a day laborer in Israel. After a Government Cabinet vote to legalize Khavat Gilad, he asks whether anything will remain. In October, bulldozers cleared land, apparently to build another home.  He lost 22 trees that day.  After months, he finally received protection to plant new trees, only after Israeli organizations asked why the army was demanding Ali again prove ownership in order to replace the trees their negligence had allowed to be cut down.  One officer promised to help protect the new trees.  The army had also promised in October..

Tonight when we declare “Let all who are hungry come and eat we know that it would be better if Ali could support himself, rather than come to our table.  We share his hope against hope that the seedlings he has planted contain the seeds of redemption.

Sheikh Sayakh: Last year Sheikh Sayakh slept on the ground near where his village once stood.  Now he is serving a 10 month jail sentence for “trespassing” on his own land, and couldn’t attend the opening of the court hearings in which he and his family seek to prove their ownership.  The judge offered to cancel his sentence if he would agree not to return to Al-Araqib, “Why at your advanced age do you need to spend 10 months in jail?” Some of his friends agreed. But, Sayakh knew that an agreement on his part would undermine his determined effort to hold on to his tribe’s land, despite over 130 demolitions of whatever he and a handful of family members manage to rebuild. Sheikh Sayakh says that those Israeli Jews who support El-Araqib help give him strength.

Our sages ask what gave our ancestors strength, and how much longer they could have survived Egyptian oppression had not God fulfilled God’s promise to stand with us. Tonight we know that we must stand with El-Araqib, and all of Israel’s Bedouin citizens.

African Asylum Seekers: A mass expulsion was supposed to take place last Passover. Israel’s High Court originally intended to allow it, but issued a temporary order when the judges realized that there was no truth to government claims that they had an agreement from a safe country to welcome them. There were all too many stories of their friends who “agreed” to leave and were killed, drowned, became slaves and/or were tortured.  Many of parties poised to form Israel’s next government are committed to passing laws making it easier for them to override the Court, when it thwarts their plans.  Asylum seekers know their future is perilous.

We were once slaves, and our Torah commands us not to return fleeing slaves to their owners. Tonight we commit to redoubling our efforts to stop plans to condemn others to slavery, or worse.

Some say that our sages of old spent seder night planning how to resist and end tyranny. Recalling the midwives of old, we know that the seeds of redemption are planted when we oppose Pharaoh’s command. Now we must decide whether the story we tell tonight is only a tale of long ago, or a story instructing us what we must do tomorrow.  The rabbis taught that the seder moves from from gnut to shevakh, from degradation to praiseworthiness. Will we?

MAY OUR STORY OF WHAT WAS STRENGTHEN OUR RESOLVE TO STRIVE FOR WHAT MUST BE:

You shall not wrong a ger (Non-Jew living among you and living by your rules) or oppress him/her, for you were gerim in the land of Egypt. (Exodus 22:20)

The great, meta-principle is oft-repeated in the Torah that it is not race, not descent, not birth nor country of origin, nor property, nor anything external or due to chance, but simply and purely the inner spiritual and moral worth of a human being, that gives him/her all the rights of a human being and of a citizen. This basic principle is further protected against infringement by the additional explanation, “For you were gerim in the land of Egypt.” … Your entire misfortune in Egypt was that you were “foreigners” and “aliens.” As such, according to the views of other nations, you had no right to be there, had no claim to property, to homeland, or to a dignified existence. It was permissible to do to you whatever they wished. As gerim, your rights were denied in Egypt. This was the source of the slavery and wretchedness imposed upon you. Therefore beware, so runs the warning, from making human rights in your own state conditional on anything other than on the basic humanity which every human being as such bears within him/her by virtue of being human. Any suppression of these human and civil rights opens the gate to the indiscriminate use of power and abuse of human beings, to the whole horror of Egyptian mishandling of human beings that was the root of abomination of Egypt.

2494,"10 Dirty Talk Phrases For Seasoned Pros That Will Both Delight & Surprise Your Partner","Maybe you've been dirty talking for a while. You've used all the classics — ""oh baby"" and ""give it to me"" and ""that feels amazing"" (fine, those examples might not be the most original, but basics work). You're ready to take things to the next level. If you're looking for dirty talk phrases for seasoned pros , look no future. I've compiled a list of the sexiest, dirtiest, and absolute best phrases to say to a partner who thinks they've heard everything. You can use these on someone you've been having sex with regularly for years or something you just met — they're going to love it nonetheless. As long as someone likes dirty talk and feels comfortable with it, you're going to have a blast.
As a writer, my one gripe with dirty-talking is that it can feel like the same phrases are used over and over. To be fair, the lack of variety mostly comes on my end (I mean, does that really feel ""so good"", or could I have racked my brain for something more original, like ""super duper good""). Still, I decided to take things up a notch with the last few people I've slept with, and I've been thrilled with the results . Dirty talk can add a lot to a sexual experience. If you say something they've never heard before, they might be turned on in a whole new way.
Read on to find 10 dirty talk phrases that will absolutely delight your partner, even if they think they've heard everything.
""Dexterous"" is a fun word that makes me think of the serial killer show Dexter (win-win). Compliment your partner on the dexterity of their tongue and you'll spice things up in the bedroom, just in time to tune into the next episode.
""You make me so wet"" is solid but simple . Try to switch it up with a fun rainforest metaphor — all the same benefits, plus, your partner will think about going on vacation, which always turns me on.
In all likelihood, you won't actually make it to the fourth dimension (I personally have never been). Still, adding hyperbole is a great way to spice up your sex life — I literally could not recommend it more!
Let them know the eroticism is so hot you're uncomfortable. Much like me when I'm in an infrared sauna — I'm squirmy, but I love it, and the second I leave, I'll miss it.
This is a fun, flirty one that lets them know you're having such a good time you're almost afraid. Don't worry, no one's going to get lost inside you (according to my gynecologist), and if they do, at least you'll have a great story.
A Game of Thrones reference turns everybody on — even the people who don't watch the show, because then they'll start thinking, ""wait, should I watch that show?"" Very hot.
7. ""If My Nipples Were Any Harder, My Bra Would Rip""
This is a very hot thing to say. Of course, it's not actually true — I've done a lot to my bras and they've stayed intact. But stretching the truth is totally fine if it turns you and your partner on.
To double the fun, do not at any point clarify what it is. This can refer to fingers, hands, tongues, sex toys, penises — anything that turns the two of you on. (However, if they start to put something in your mouth you don't want there, let me them know — dirty talk is great, but communication is even better).
This is a great visual, but also be careful to check what panties you're wearing — if they're your nicest pair, you might want to try something more subtle, like ""rip my panties off with your teeth but actually just pull them down, please don't rip them, they cost $32."" That's slightly less sexy but still gets the point across.
This is a fun finisher to let them know they did a great job. After all, sex is a workout.
You might think you've heard everything there is to hear, but there's always more dirty talk for the seasoned pro. Try one of these ten phrases to absolutely delight your partner, and even if they're a dirty talk aficionado, I guarantee they'll be aroused — or at the very least, aroused.","__label__Positive"
2264,"Adrian Peterson is a problem again and heading for the Giants","When Adrian Peterson runs well, Washington wins.

Now 33, Peterson introduced himself to an NFC East rivalry by running at the Cowboys, through the Cowboys and past the Cowboys on Sunday. He darted, lowered his shoulder and altogether dominated Dallas en route to a 20-17 win for Washington. The Redskins are now 4-2 and in sole possession of first place.

Hail to the running back. The Giants are next in line to try to stop him.

Peterson put up 99 yards. He broke tackles, lateraled to his quarterback on the 1-yard line and continued his re-emergence as a No. 1 tailback one year after splitting a season between New Orleans and Arizona.

“I expect greatness from myself,” he said. “That’s why I put the work in. God has blessed me with a tremendous talent.”

In Washington’s two losses, Peterson was held to 6 yards and 20 yards. In the wins, he has put up 96, 120, 97 and 99. And his effort almost wasn’t enough Sunday before a seldom-called penalty for a “snap infraction” against Dallas long snapper L.P. Ladoceur turned a 47-yard Cowboys field-goal attempt into a 52-yard try that bounced off the left upright as time expired.

As painful as that loss would have been, pain has not slowed Peterson. During Washington’s loss to the Saints two weeks ago, Peterson dislocated his shoulder. He suited up the next week, and has continued to play because he believes it is his role as a leader to carry on.

“I can endure a little pain to help my team be successful,” he said. “That’s just the mindset I’ve approached this game with.”

Peterson also has his eye on next week’s matchup with the Giants. When asked whether or not he had seen rookie Saquon Barkley run the ball, Peterson complimented Barkley, saying, “I’ve had the opportunity to kind of sit back and watch him. He’s nice, man. He’s a heck of a football player. He has impressed me so far. It will be good to watch some film. I’ll be watching some of his highlights.”

Peterson has long been considered the tailback archetype in the modern era. He has rushed for more than 12,000 yards in his career, and is now in his 12th season.

Peterson and Barkley are new faces in an old rivalry. May the best back carry his team to a victory next week.

It was two and out for Blake Bortles.

First, he fumbled the ball on a third down after picking up 3 yards. Then, after falling behind 13-0 to Houston, he fumbled again on a third down.

Doug Marrone made sure Bortles would not lose the ball a third time. The starting quarterback was benched in favor of Cody Kessler, who was subsequently sacked four times as the Jaguars fell, 20-7.

It was Week 7. Jacksonville is now 3-4 with no certainty that either quarterback can keep the ball away from the defense as Kessler threw a pick, too.

Marrone made it clear afterward. The position is now “open.”

“I’m focused on how do we stop turning the ball over,” Marrone said. “It’s hard for me in my mind to sit here right now and try to say if we can do this, we can do … we can’t do s— until we stop turning the ball over. Period. That’s just how it is.”

Tom Coughlin’s team needs a quarterback. Eli Manning appears to be on his last legs in East Rutherford. If only the Giants had a quarterback to turn to now.

For now, Jacksonville is the biggest disappointment of the fall. A win away from the Super Bowl last January, Jacksonville started this campaign with a win over the Giants on the road and then gained vengeance over the Patriots in Florida. Since then, the Jaguars have lost four of their past five. The only win in that span was over the Jets.

What would Doug Marrone’s unit be without the New York teams?

Starting Bortles is officially a 50-50 proposition. He managed to complete only six of his 12 pass attempts for 61 yards in the latest loss. On the year, he has nine touchdowns and eight interceptions. He also has five fumbles.

“I don’t think anything ever surprises you playing the game at this level,” Bortles said of his benching.

Playoff Blake has been missing during the slide. His passer rating was 64.9 against the Texans. It is 81.1 for the season. His counterpart, Deshaun Watson wasn’t much better — 12-of-24 for 139 yards and a touchdown. But Watson kept the Texans out front because he maintained possession of the ball.

In the AFC South, being a middling team means being in second place at the moment. First place and a playoff spot are all within reach. Bortles needs to be better or Kessler needs to show he can hold onto the ball.

Next up: the defending Super Bowl champions, who are also 3-4.

Both teams are aware just how quickly things can change.

Catanzaro’s kick broke a 23-23 tie in Tampa’s 26-23 overtime victory over the Browns. It was also a redemptive kick. Catanzaro missed an extra point and a field goal earlier in the contest. The latter came from 40 yards at the end of regulation.

“He bounced back twice,” Winston said. “A win is a win and you gotta love ’em.”

Catanzaro’s kick helped make up for Winston’s miscues, as well. The quarterback was picked off twice and threw no touchdowns as he completed 32-of-52 passes for 360 yards.

To go for two or to go for one: That was the question across the pond.

The Titans drove 89 yards over the final 4:55 of their game against the Chargers before quarterback Marcus Mariota threw a 1-yard pass to tight end Luke Stocker. Down one, the Titans went for two points and the win.

Mariota threw a pass intended for Tajae Sharp, and it was incomplete. Defensive holding was whistled, and it negated the failed attempt. Chargers safety Adrian Phillips tipped the second try and it fell incomplete, as well.

“I loved the call,” Mariota said. “I love that he has confidence in us to go make that. We just didn’t execute.”

play of the game. The ball was on the Bears’ 45-yard line with two seconds left. Trubisky received pressure from his blind side, and then threw the ball with a pass rusher in his face. The ball traveled to the Patriots’ 1-yard line, where Chicago wideout Kevin White (two catches, 64 yards) came down with it. He pivoted, but four Patriots struck him to keep White from scoring a game-tying touchdown. New England is now 5-2, but all acknowledged how close this one was at the end.

“He got a good throw on it.” Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said. “You hold your breath.”

Drew Brees isn’t satisfied with his record collection. The Saints quarterback picked up another milestone when he threw his 500th career touchdown pass in a 24-23 win over the Ravens. It came on a 1-yard flip to tight end Benjamin Watson for a 7-3 lead in the second quarter. Brees is now in a fraternity of four with that mark. Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Brett Favre are the other members. New Orleans is now 5-1. … Beware the Rally Cats in Charlotte. The Eagles flew out to a 10-0 lead at halftime and went up 17 points in the third quarter. Quarterback Cam Newton led the charge from there as the Panthers pulled off the biggest comeback in franchise history, scoring 21 points in the fourth to win, 21-17. Newton threw a pair of touchdown passes. … Now 33 years old, Adrian Peterson continued to put up age-defying numbers with 99 yards in Washington’s 20-17 win over the Cowboys. In Washington’s two losses, Peterson was held to 6 yards and 20 yards. In the wins, he has put up 96, 120, 97 and 99. Washingon is 4-2 and in first place in the NFC East.

Philip Rivers, Chargers: No one looked more efficient than Old Man Rivers. In outlasting the Titans, he completed 19-of-26 passes for 306 yards and a pair of touchdowns without Melvin Gordon.

Josh Gordon, Patriots: Tom Brady’s new toy saw his impact grow with four catches for 100 yards. In the fourth quarter, his 55-yard catch-and-run set up the Patriots’ final touchdown.

Kerryon Johnson, Lions: The rookie out of Auburn rushed for 158 yards on 19 carries and added 21 yards on two catches during the Lions’ 32-21 win over the Dolphins.

— Panthers safety Eric Reid on Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins. Reid has made it clear he had a problem with the NFL and Jenkins, who played a lead role in the Players Coalition’s reaching a deal with owners. Reid left the coalition because Jenkins excluded Colin Kaepernick from meetings. Reid and Jenkins exchanged words prior to the game, and Reid body slammed Zach Ertz after Reid hit quarterback Carson Wentz late following a handoff.

Fantasy owners have been waiting for a Marlon Mack breakout, and they got it Sunday, getting 19-for-126 and a score on the ground and another 2-for-33 and a touchdown receiving. It was just his third game this year. Last season he missed two and was banged up for several more. Cash in on his big day and deal him for a more reliable asset.

The tight end position is a fantasy wasteland. So when you see Detroit’s Michael Roberts haul in a pair of TDs this week, you pay attention. Understand, he has four targets this season — four! — yet has three TDs. Need a bye-week filler, sure, take the red-zone efficiency and hope for a TD. Every week? Not a chance.

After nine catches on 10 targets for 94 yards last week, it looked like Jermaine Kearse was going to be a reliable replacement for Quincy Enunwa. Then, a fantasy doughnut Sunday — zero catches on two targets. Reminder: Replacements are replacements for a reason.","__label__Positive"

According to fashion search engine Love the Sales , the total cost of all Markle’s maternity outfits comes to a whopping £478,920, or about $632,000 — which is more than seven times what her sister-in-law Kate Middleton spent on her pregnancy wardrobe.
Not all of the Duchess of Sussex’s looks were equally budget-busting, however. While her priciest ensemble was the approximately $13,200 bespoke Oscar de la Renta dress covered in laser-cut birds she wore to the Geographic Society Awards in October, she also sported a knit H&amp;M maternity dress that cost just $35 in January.
The fast fashion retailer was just one of the many brands to benefit from the so-called “Meghan Maternity Effect” throughout the royal’s pregnancy. Her H&amp;M dress sold out in just 24 hours, and even popped up on eBay for as much as six times its retail price. Meanwhile, searches for Markle’s Veja V-10 sneakers spiked by over 300 percent after the duchess was spotted wearing the $150 shoes in October.
Searches for Australian designer Karen Gee similarly shot up by over 5,800 percent after Markle wore the brand’s “Blessed” dress after announcing her pregnancy, while Outland Denim ‘s sales spiked over 2,300 percent thanks to the royal’s continued support .
And while it’s against royal protocol for Markle (or any member of the royal family) to accept free clothing, British taxpayers won’t be footing the bill for the duchess’ maternity duds: They’ll be paid for by Prince Charles, just like the rest of her famously costly closet .","__label__Neutral"
736,"Cohen spoke with Russian to set up Trump-Putin meeting, Mueller reveals - The Guardian","Cohen spoke with Russian to set up Trump-Putin meeting, Mueller reveals

One of Donald Trump’s closest advisers spoke during the 2016 election campaign with a Russian offering help from Moscow and a meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin , the special counsel Robert Mueller revealed on Friday.

Manafort lied on five separate matters after agreeing to cooperate, Mueller says

Federal prosecutors also alleged that Trump directed the adviser, Michael Cohen , to make illegal payoffs to two women who claimed to have had sexual relationships with Trump, implicating the president in the violation of campaign finance laws. They recommended that Cohen receive a prison sentence of about four years.

The disclosures heaped new pressure on Trump, whose presidency has come under siege from Mueller’s investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 US election and a spinoff inquiry into Cohen, his lawyer and legal fixer for more than a decade.

They were swiftly followed by new revelations in the criminal prosecution of Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. He was accused by Mueller of repeatedly lying about his relationship with an alleged former Russian intelligence operative and about his recent communications with Trump’s White House.

Following a week of increasingly frenzied attacks against Mueller, Trump falsely stated on Friday evening that the latest development “totally clears” him. In fact, investigations appeared to be edging ever closer to the door of the Oval Office.

Mueller said in a court filing that Cohen had provided him “useful information” on matters at the core of the Trump-Russia investigation . He also recounted details of communications with people “connected to the White House” this year and last, Mueller said, hinting Cohen may have implicated Trump and aides in additional wrongdoing.

The special counsel’s filing said Cohen’s November 2015 conversation with a Russian national was among other “contacts with Russian interests” he had while the Kremlin was interfering in the election to help Trump.

Cohen also told investigators he made efforts to contact the Russian government to propose a meeting between Trump and Putin in New York in September 2015, after discussing this with Trump.

In a separate filing, federal prosecutors in New York said Cohen “acted in coordination and at the direction of” Trump when setting up payments to buy the silence of Karen McDougal, a former model, and Stormy Daniels, a pornographic actor, who were considering making public their allegations of affairs with Trump.

Cohen and Trump paid the women to suppress their damaging stories and “to influence the 2016 presidential election”, the filing said.

The White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters the filings contained “nothing of value that wasn’t already known”, saying Cohen had “repeatedly lied” and was “no hero”.

Mueller separately alleged that Manafort falsely claimed he had had no contact with anyone in Trump’s administration since they entered office. In fact, Mueller said, he was in communication with a senior official until February this year, and asked an intermediary to talk to an official on his behalf as recently as late May.

The contacts will be of great interest to investigators. Whether Manafort’s ties to pro-Kremlin figures in eastern Europe are connected to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election remains the central unanswered question in the Trump-Russia inquiry.

While Mueller said Cohen provided significant help to his investigation, prosecutors said Cohen had overstated his overall cooperation with the government and had shown a “rose-colored view of the seriousness of the crimes”.

Cohen was motivated by greed and “repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends”, the prosecutors said in a court filing. “After cheating the [Internal Revenue Service] for years, lying to banks and to Congress, and seeking to criminally influence the presidential election, Cohen’s decision to plead guilty – rather than seek a pardon for his manifold crimes – does not make him a hero.”

Despite his wrongdoing, Mueller said, Cohen disclosed “useful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters” at the core of his investigation. US intelligence agencies have concluded Russia’s interference was aimed at helping Trump and harming the campaign of Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent.

Cohen previously pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump’s plans to develop a building in Russia. He admitted the project continued well into Trump’s campaign for the presidency – contradicting Trump’s account – and that Cohen spoke with a Kremlin official about securing Russian government support.","__label__Neutral"

The Pistons are in the middle of a playoff race in the Eastern Conference, but they were so confident in their ability to beat the Cavaliers, that they decided to rest Blake Griffin. But perhaps they should have thought twice, as Detroit lost 126-119 to Cleveland. The forward has been incredible this season, but there have been some signs lately that he's in need of a break. Over the last 10 games, his efficiency and productivity have dipped, which perhaps shouldn't be surprising given how much he's done for the Pistons this season. After a big win over the Raptors on Sunday, giving Griffin the night off Monday against a weak Cavs team made plenty of sense but it didn't quite work out.

2604,"Take a shot on Providence","Want even more betting news? Sign up for VSiN's free daily newsletter Want even more betting news? Sign up for VSiN's free daily newsletter
Providence and Texas, on paper, look quite similar. Each team has three losses, each has a points differential between 7.9 and 8.4 and each surrenders between 67.8 and 66.5 points per game.
Yet Texas opened as close to a double-digit favorite.
What makes this matchup in Austin (9 p.m., ESPN) more intriguing is it’s a road game for Providence, which defeated Boston College in overtime as an underdog in its only true road game this season.
This line could be because of recency bias with Texas coming off a close home win against Purdue and a 98-60 drubbing of Grand Canyon. Before that, the Longhorns were 2-6 against the spread, with two outright home losses against Radford and VCU. In both games, Texas closed as a favorite of at least 10 points, similar to the opening number of 9¹/₂ for Friday’s contest.
Alpha Diallo is leading Providence in points, rebounds, and assists. At 6-foot-7, he will present a big issue to Texas’ Kerwin Roach, assuming that is the matchup.
Providence comes in the more efficient offense, ranked 82nd among Division I teams in points per possession, while Texas is 152nd.
Providence is 30th in the country in 3-point shooting percentage and is going up against a team that has been downed by teams far worse from beyond the arc.
VCU and Radford shot a combined 12-for-46 from distance in their upset wins. If the Friars can hit anywhere near their season percentage, it will force Texas, ranked 219th in 3-point percentage, to play above-average just to win, let alone cover.","__label__Neutral"

“The sultan has decreed that no quarters should involve His Highness' name in whatever rallies organised by political parties or NGOs. Such statements can confuse the public.

“As the ruler of Selangor, the sultan should not be linked to any rallies organised by any quarter,” he added in a statement this evening.

Therefore, Munir said Sultan Sharafuddin Idris Shah has reminded the people not to be influenced by such fake news.

Meanwhile, a statement posted on the Johor sultan's official Facebook page stated that Sultan Ibrahim Sultan Iskandar was ""annoyed"" over rumours that he would be participating in the rally.

It also said that the sultan had issued a decree reminding the public not to easily believe the fake news which had gone viral on social media.

“I would like to remind everyone that there are all sorts of fake information being circulated on social media.

“Please don’t be easily influenced and believe anything you read. Always verify them first,"" said the statement, which also mentioned that the sultan of Johor is currently visiting Japan.

1201,"Why Was This Japanese Otter Fired As Her City's Tourism Ambassador?","There are not one, not two, but three different otters involved in the firing of Chiitan, an otter who formerly held the job of honorary tourism ambassador for the city of Susaki in southern Japan. To make matters even more confusing, two of the otters involved in this beef are named Chiitan, and two of them are not real otters, but rather otter mascots made by the same designer. Thanks to essential reporting by The New York Times, we have a clearer picture of how it all went down. Chiitan (who I will call Chiitan I), the real otter who was unceremoniously booted from her job, was originally granted the position because of her large social media following and the fact that giving an otter a job is objectively a cool thing to do. At the time, the city already had an official otter mascot, Shinjokun, who was based on an extinct species of river otter. Shinjokun, it absolutely must be noted, wears a “bowl of local noodles” as a hat.   When Chiitan I was hired, the designers who created Shinjokun made a mascot based on Chiitan I, also named Chiitan (who I will call Chiitan II). Chiitan II, it absolutely must be noted, wears a turtle as a hat. Chiitan II, an unsanctioned mascot, then became thirsty for clicks, posting videos of herself performing a bunch of unsanctioned stunts, including beating a punching bag, tipping over a car, playing with a weed whacker, and menacingly sticking a baseball bat in her suit with the caption “Chiitan going to visit your house.”     According to the Times, the city received over 100 calls complaining about Chiitan II. So they decided to fire Chiitan I in an attempt to dissociate themselves. But, as the Times reports, this has only conflated the two even further: “Posts about Chiitan being ‘fired’ (the mascot and the real otter have the same name) have since gone viral on social media, incorrectly implying that the city had officially sanctioned the rogue mascot’s cheeky antics.”  Meanwhile, Chiitan II is continuing her shenanigans, while Shinjokun is still the official mascot and still inexplicably wears a bowl of noodles as a hat.    Most importantly, all of this remains both rude and disrespectful to Chiitan I, considering that she remains out of a job through no fault of her own.","__label__Neutral"
1571,"Ikea&#8217;s latest recall is terrifying","Months after Ikea recalled a product that killed two dogs  from its first line of pet furniture, Ikea announced a sweeping recall of a popular ceiling lamp that has a tendency to fall off by surprise above unsuspecting people (and their pets), showering them with dangerous glass shards and “posing impact and laceration hazards.”

The recall of the lamp–which has a surprisingly pronounceable name free of Swedish-inspired epithets with too many consonants, Calypso–follows 19 complaints filed to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the independent government agency that develops safety standards and tries to protect buyers against unreasonable risks. The reports describe the $34.99 Calypso’s frosted glass shade detaching from its steel base plate at random, crashing to the floor (or unfortunate passersby).

The reports include three minor injuries. Fortunately, that only means a few bumps and cuts. The affected lamps, which have an average rating on Ikea’s U.S. site of two stars out of five over 30 reviews, were sold from August 2016 to July 2018 (I’ve reached out to Ikea and will update this post if I receive more information.)

If you have a Calypso you can check out the manufacturing codes on the base plate: If it’s between 1625 and 1744, you have a killer lamp. If you do, approach with care, try not to startle it, capture it carefully, and take it to your nearest Ikea for a refund or a replacement.","__label__Neutral"
2495,"How To Kindly Cancel A Date At The Last Minute If Something Unexpected Came Up","In a world where ghosting and standing people up is more common than it should be, figuring out how to kindly cancel a date at the last minute can be life-changing for some. Instead of simply not showing up because you don't feel any sort of connection or because you're trying to cut your ties with this person altogether, sending a simple text explaining why can go a long way — even if it's not what someone wants to hear. Whether it's as blunt as ""I don't want to do this,"" or a little more subtle like, ""Something came up, can we reschedule?"" kindly canceling a date is so much better than just never showing up.
""It's important to understand the reason why you want to cancel in the first place,"" Sasha Aurund , editor at Psych&amp;Sex, tells Elite Daily. ""We don't owe our time to anyone but ourselves. Understanding the motivation behind why you want to go on a date will help you decide the best course of action when canceling . If something came up which was uncontrollable, it can be as simple as a phone call explaining the situation — if you feel it will help propel the romantic interest and not hinder it. If you are simply putting it off because you don't want to make time for the person, use the method you find most appropriate (text, call, DM) and just be simple but honest.""
If you actually wanted to go out with the person, and something really did come up, then as soon as you let your date know you can't make it, ask them to reschedule. They may be hesitant and curious to know what caused you to have to cancel. Though you don't owe them any explanation, and they should trust you, giving them a concrete reason may help them see it's not something you do often — especially if they're just getting to know you. ""If you genuinely want to make time for another person, respect their time as well and cancel through the phone,"" Aurund says. ""You shouldn't need to say or do anything specifically to prove you're not 'flaking.' All good relationships (romantic or not) are built on trust and understanding — this should be no different.""
If, on the other hand, you don't exactly want to continue dating this person, you should still approach the topic kindly. ""Even if you are only casually dating, don't sound dismissive,"" Nikki Leigh, a love and relationships coach and host of Ready for Love Radio , tells Elite Daily. ""Everyone has feelings and consider how you would like a person to break a date with you."" Canceling on someone at the last minute can be disheartening, especially if you're not interested, and you don't want to hurt them more by being rude about it.
So, whether or not your date is someone you want to see again or not may change how you cancel on them , but it doesn't change the fact that you should let them down easy. ""If the date is with someone you are dating regularly or someone you want to see again, go ahead and let them know that you are sorry you have to cancel this date , but you would love to reschedule,"" Leigh suggests. ""If you aren't sure you want to see the person again, maybe hold off on rescheduling, and maybe put a little distance between you, and decide what you want to do in a few days or a week."" Once you've decided, be honest and be kind. The rest will fall into place.","__label__Neutral"
1407,"College Football Playoff Rankings judgments: LSU getting too much credit, Auburn overrated","We had to wait a little longer than usual thanks to a college basketball game between Kansas and Michigan -- scheduling the rankings show between the basketball games every season is sadistic -- but the latest College Football Playoff Rankings are out , and you know what that means: I have thoughts on them.
I understand what the committee likes about LSU. It's a team with wins over No. 24 Auburn (more on the Tigers later), No. 5 Georgia and No. 16 Mississippi State. You could argue that as far as wins are concerned, there might not be a team with a better set of wins in the country. But the Tigers also have two losses. Yes, those losses are to No. 1 Alabama and No. 15 Florida, but LSU's flaws were made bare for the world to see on Saturday night against Alabama.
Simply put, LSU is a good team. It will likely finish the season as a top 10 team in the country, but it can't compete with the elite. It has a strong defense, but offensively, it's limited at best. Also, it has no shot to get back into the top four or win its division, so it's playoff hopes are essentially dead. So why do we even need to keep it ranked ahead of other teams who still have real playoff hopes at the moment?
Again, this Tigers team is good. Losing to Alabama doesn't make it bad, even if it looked hopeless doing so. But it shouldn't be ahead of a few of the teams behind it right now. Not until they have a second loss of their own, anyway.
This is a simple case of two teams I believe should be swapped in the pecking order. Both have one loss on the season, but West Virginia's lone loss was by 16 on the road against No. 22 Iowa State. Wazzu's loss was by three on the road to an unranked 5-4 USC team. When it comes to wins, West Virginia has a win over No. 19 Texas; Washington State hasn't beaten a team currently in the rankings, though it may have a chance against a ranked Washington team to end the regular season.
Finally, according to the Sagarin ratings, West Virginia has played the 45th most-difficult schedule in the country. So both teams have one loss, but West Virginia has the best win, the best loss, and it has played the more difficult schedule. These teams should be swapped.
You know, I'm one of those people who doesn't think the SEC is overrated. I think it's just a very good conference, and it's the best conference in the country, even if the rest of the league gets a bit too much credit for what Alabama has done. But crap like this makes it hard to deny there's an SEC bias with the CFP Selection Committee.
How the hell is Auburn ranked? We're talking about a team that's 6-3, one that literally needed its athletic director to publicly go on the record Tuesday that they won't be firing their coach this season. This is a team whose best win, according to the committee, was 21-16 over No. 25 Washington on opening weekend. You know what's happened since then? The Tigers have lost three times, including a home loss to a Tennessee team that could only manage 14 points against Charlotte on Saturday.
Listen, I know that when it comes to the bottom of the rankings, it's hard to find worthy teams, but it's much more difficult to look at this Auburn team and deem it as one of the 25 best in the country.
You know who would have been fine in the 24 or 25 spot that wouldn't have been a problem? Utah State. Is it a team that deserves a top 10 or top 15 spot? No, of course not. But what Utah State is is an 8-1 team that's only loss was a seven-point loss on the road against No. 18 Michigan State. Now, the Aggies have only beaten one team with a winning record -- Hawaii -- so they don't have the strength of schedule to warrant being ranked much higher, but even if they haven't played the most challenging schedule, they've annihilated everyone in their path. Utah State's eight wins have come by an average of 32.9 points per game.
Utah State's only crime is that it's a Group of Five school, and if we start putting too many Group of Five schools in the CFP Rankings (there are two, compared to four in both the AP and Coaches Polls) then we might run the risk of giving teams like UCF too much credibility and leverage when it comes to how we rank them.
And we can't have that, can we?

167,"World's Largest Hedge Fund Manager Sees Dollar Losing Reserve Currency Status","With the end of 2018 marking the 40th anniversary of China opening up &amp; reforming (and with an increasingly loud group of market participants questioning the foundations of China’s economic miracle - and more importantly, it's future), Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio believes now is a good time to reflect on China’s last 40 years.
""Since I have been fortunate to have experienced 34 years of this 40 years in an up close and intimate way, and since I study what makes countries succeed and fail, I have some experiences and thoughts to share...""
The table below shows just a few representative statistics.
These results speak for themselves, but Dalio adds:
And from what Dalio has seen, he believes that the very impressive results that the Chinese leadership and the Chinese people produced came about primarily because of the powerful combination of
a) China’s opening up and reforming following an extended period of isolation that led to a fast catching up (especially in the coastal regions of China) with the advanced developed world, and
b) the power of the Chinese culture and it’ related ways of operating.
Crucially, the billionaire hedge fund manager points out that, if you haven’t spent time in China, you need to get any stereotypes you might have out of your mind because it’s not how it was. This is not your father’s communism. It is “socialism with Chinese characteristics” that has been significantly and very effectively reformed, which has made it much more vital, creative, and economically free.
Dalio's 'romantic' view of a paternal China is definitely not the mainstream narrative:
""From my experiences and from what I am told by Chinese who should know, I believe Chinese leadership seeks to run the country the way they believe a good family should be run, from the top down, maintaining high standards of behavior, putting the collective interest ahead of any individual interest, with each member knowing their place and having filial respect for those in the hierarchy so the system works in an orderly way. One of China’s leaders who explained this concept to me told that the word “country” consists of two characters, state and family, which influences how they view their role in looking after their state/family.
One might say that the Chinese government is paternal. For example, it regulates what types of video games are watched by children and how many hours a day they play them. As a broad generalization, when the interest of the country (like the family) is at odds with the interest of the individual, the interest of the country (like the interest of the family) should be favored over the interest of the individual. Individuals are parts of a greater machine. As a result of this perspective, the system seeks to develop, promote and reward good character and good citizenship. For example it gives people a social credit score that rates the quality of their citizenship. And each person is expected to view themselves as parts of the greater whole.
 This management from the top down includes visualizing what China 5, 10 and 20 years in the future should be like and then making and managing detailed multiyear plans to build out that vision, with the goal being to make China as great as it can be. China is run more like a giant company with many subsidiaries, some within the government’s direct control and some within its indirect control. ""
But, as the fund manager notes, while Chinese culture has been evolving, it has at its most fundamental level been operating in similar ways for many hundreds or even thousands of years and the results of operating that way are knowable in an approximate way. 
""I have recently been researching the rise and fall of reserve currencies, which led me to study the rises and declines of the world’s most powerful countries. That led my research team and me to put together the following indices of the relative powers of leading countries since 1500. These indices are a combination of six sub-indices that measure six different types of power:
3) share of world trade,
4) financial-center size and power,
As shown in the chart below, China was either the number one or number two most powerful country from 1500 to around 1800 when it went into relative decline...
That decline continued until around 40 years ago, when, as Dalio explains rather ominously for the American hegemon:
Given that impressive track record and how deeply imbued the culture behind it is, we shouldn’t expect China’s most fundamental ways of operating to change much. As a result, Dalio warns:
""while trade deals can be made, attempts to change “Chinese characteristics”, - most importantly to change the top-down government management of most/all aspects of the system pursuit of making China as great as it can be - won’t work.""
So, in summary, ""it's not the economy, it's the culture stupid!""
And judging by Dalio's take on American culture, it is clear where he thinks this is going...
""Most fundamentally, the US is a country in which individuals, individualism, and individual property rights are perceived to be of paramount importance it is directed from the bottom up (e.g., through “one man, one vote” democracies that empower people to choose their leaders), being revolutionary is considered a good thing, and conflict is valued more than harmony. 
Rather than respecting top down control most American have a strong preference to keep government from interfering with their most individual choices. Character development is a personal or family issue, not a government issue (which leaves it largely neglected in areas with broken families, especially if they’re poor).
Rather than there being a long-term top down vision for the country and a plan to achieve that vision, in the capitalist and democratic system such directions are more bottom up determined based on commercial and popularity considerations.""
Of course, the world's largest hedge fund manager avoids directly slamming America's 'dream' or supporting China's central planners:
However, Dalio signals the following seven things as the most important to follow:
1) China has a culture and system that has worked well for it for a long time so it shouldn’t be expected to change much,
3) these systems (and those of other countries) will be both competing and cooperating, and how well they do that will be an important influence on global conditions,
4) how well each system works in practice will have a far greater influence on where each country stands in the future than the terms of the deals that they strike with each other, so each would do well to examine its own weaknesses and come up with reforms to rectify them, and
5) there is a lot to respect about the Chinese culture and approach that led to its remarkable accomplishments,
6) we would do well to learn from each other, cooperate and compete to bring each other up rather than to tear each other down, and
7) China is a place we need to continue to evolve with and invest in.","__label__Positive"

1801,"American soldiers killed in ISIS-claimed suicide attack in Syria","American teen caught fighting with ISIS in Syria: Kurds

Four American soldiers were among 16 people killed and more than a dozen wounded when a suicide bomber attacked US-led coalition forces in the northern Syrian city of Manbij on Wednesday, according to a US official.

An ISIS-affiliated web site, Amaq, said a suicide attacker with an explosive vest had targeted a foreign military patrol.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a militia source said US troops were among the dead, according to Reuters, which reported that four were killed.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement: “The President has been fully briefed and we will continue to monitor the ongoing situation in Syria. For any specific questions please contact the Department of Defense.”

There was no immediate comment from the coalition or the US military about the explosion or casualties.

“We are aware of the reports. We are working to get information and CENTCOM is going to release something when it’s appropriate,” a US military official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The Kurdish Hawar news agency and the UK-based Observatory reported US troops were among the casualties.

Turkey’s state-run Anadolu Agency, citing unnamed local sources, said a number of American soldiers were injured and that the US military evacuated troops by helicopter.

Last month, President Trump made a surprise announcement that he would withdraw all 2,000 US troops from Syria after concluding ISIS had been defeated there.

The announcement rattled allies and top US officials, including Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who resigned in protest.

Opponents of the US pullout warned that Manbij and other towns near the border with Turkey might come under attack by the Turkish military, which has threatened to invade to clear them of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units militia, or YPG.

Turkey considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which has long fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey.

Two witnesses described Wednesday’s blast to Reuters.

“An explosion hit near a restaurant, targeting the Americans, and there were some forces for the Manbij Military Council with them,” one said.

The Manbij Military Council militia has controlled the town since American-backed Kurdish-led forces took it from ISIS in 2016.

It is located near areas held by Russian-backed Syrian government forces and by Turkish-backed fighters opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.

On Dec. 19, Trump tweeted that the US had “defeated ISIS in Syria,” adding that was the “only reason” to have troops on the ground there.

“We have won against ISIS. We have beaten them and we have beaten them badly,” he said in a video.

Administration officials later said the withdrawal will happen more slowly – though a US military official last week said that the American-led military coalition has begun the process of withdrawing troops from Syria.","__label__Neutral"

You learn a thing or two in that amount of time — like how to integrate tech from Gore-Tex to make the first waterproof hiking boot, which Danner did in 1979. This old dog isn’t dumb to new tricks though, as demonstrated in its newest boot, the Mountain 600 Chelsea.

The new slip-on boot builds on the success Danner has found in its city-to-mountain Mountain 600 collection, which offers an approachable alternative to the brand’s stiff and durable hikers, something that can take its wearer to a nearby summit but is comfortable enough to hang around town too. The Chelsea leans harder into that urban appeal, but still comes equipped with a durable full-grain leather upper that’ll wear-in over time and a Vibram Megagrip rubber outsole for traction anywhere.

If you’re thinking of buying Danner’s first slip-on boot, know that the brand recommends that the best fit is found by sizing down half a size.","__label__Neutral"
1909,"Owners behind LA’s $1B “Mountain” listing reject $400M offer","Secured Capital Partners counters at $600M, 40% less than original ask of $1B

The never-ending saga of the 157 acres of undeveloped land in Beverly Hills Post Office that can’t seem to find an owner willing to build on it will carry on at least a little while longer.

The ownership group behind the so-called “Mountain of Beverly Hills” have rejected developer Scott Gillen’s $400 million offer to buy the property, TMZ reported. A spokesperson for Gillen confirmed the report to The Real Deal.

Instead, Secure Capital Partners, an entity controlled by the Victorino Noval family, countered at $600 million. That’s still $400 million less than their initial monstrous ask of $1 billion last summer — the highest ever for a Los Angeles listing.

“I saw an opportunity to expand my brand in the city, something I’ve wanted to do for some time,” Gillen told TMZ. “If they’re smart, they’ll take the offer.”

Gillen, a luxury home developer, wanted to build six homes on the massive property, which currently has six graded pads. He’s building a similar development in Malibu, where he broke records when he paid $50 million for a 24-acre spread of undeveloped land. The Unvarnished founder is building five homes on the property.

Aaron Kirman at Compass, who has the Mountain listing, did not respond to requests for comment.

Many brokers in L.A. have scoffed at the idea that the owners will get anywhere close to $1 billion for the property, and spec builders have turned away from the property because of its many challenges. The Mountain, which has nearly 25 acres of usable land, may be closer in value to $300 million, The Real Deal previously reported. [TMZ] – Natalie Hoberman","__label__Neutral"
2403,"Gary Sanchez’s Yankees’ return date coming into focus","If the Yankees believe Gary Sanchez is completely healed from his strained left calf by Sunday, the catcher is prepared to jump off the injured list and play that afternoon against the Royals.
“Think the last day is Saturday for me on injured list,’’ said Sanchez, who went on the 10-day IL on April 12, with the move backdated to April 11. “Up to them. If they activate me Sunday, I’ll be ready.’’
Sanchez tested his calf Tuesday and Wednesday running on the field at Yankee Stadium without an issue.
“I just feel good running out there,’’ Sanchez, who is hitting .268 with six homers and 11 RBIs in 11 games, said before Wednesday’s 5-3 Yankees win over the Red Sox .
Sanchez said he has been following the Yankees’ rehab plans and has arrived at the point at which he can play Sunday.
“Once the 10 days are up, I think I’ll be ready,’’ said Sanchez, who is scheduled to take batting practice outside on Thursday for the first time since being shelved. “I think I’ll do a regular routine in the cage as well.’’
Sanchez has done some catching off a machine indoors and will likely need to do some live work on the field before convincing the Yankees he could be ready by Sunday. Of course, Sanchez also could be used as the designated hitter Sunday.
Always conservative, the Yankees could hold Sanchez out until Tuesday night in Anaheim to see how his calf responds to Sunday night’s cross-country flight.
With the Yankees’ IL filled with big names, manager Aaron Boone wasn’t ready to declare Sanchez ready days before he had to.
“It’s possible,’’ Boone said of Sanchez playing Sunday. “Let’s get through [Wednesday] and map out a plan for the weekend. No question we feel good about how it’s gone and how he’s responded.’’
Boone said outfielder Giancarlo Stanton is showing progress coming back from a strained left biceps that limited him to three games before he went on the shelf April 1. The manager, however, wasn’t ready to say Stanton will be ready to come off the IL when the Yankees open their nine-game western tour on Monday against the Angels.
“I don’t know that yet. He is progressing well and hit off the machine with intensity [Tuesday],’’ Boone said. “It’s hard for me to say. I know he is getting better and feel like he is getting better but I am not certain on [playing in Anaheim].’’
The Royals are scheduled on Friday to start right-hander Jakob Junis, the pitcher who hit Aaron Judge with a pitch and fractured his right wrist last July in The Bronx. Judge missed 45 games because of the injury.
Brett Gardner said he doesn’t believe Red Sox reliever Erasmo Ramirez intended to hit him in the right arm with a pitch in the seventh inning Tuesday. The plunking didn’t keep Gardner out of Wednesday night’s game, in which he batted leadoff against former Yankees teammate Nate Eovaldi and smacked a go-ahead grand slam in the seventh inning.","__label__Neutral"
2324,"Immigrant rights attorneys and journalists denied entry into Mexico - Los Angeles Times","Nora Phillips, right, is in tears as she is greeted by fellow immigration attorney Helen Sklar, left, as Phillips arrived at Los Angeles International Airport. Phillips was sent home when her U.S. passport was flagged while she tried traveling to Mexico. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)

Two U.S. immigrant rights attorneys and two journalists who have worked closely with members of a migrant caravan in Tijuana said they had been denied entry into Mexico in recent days after their passports were flagged with alerts by an unknown government.

Their stories are nearly identical: All four report being detained by Mexican immigration authorities while trying to enter the country, and eventually being turned back because the authorities said their passports had been flagged.

It is unclear which government or governments, if any, might have issued the alerts.

The U.S. State Department declined to comment Friday, and the Homeland Security Department and Customs and Border Protection did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department directed The Times to Mexican officials. Representatives for the Mexican government did not respond to requests for comment.

The two attorneys who were denied entry into Mexico, Nora Phillips and Erika Pinheiro, are leaders of Al Otro Lado, a nonprofit group based in Los Angeles and Tijuana that has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

In 2017, the group filed a lawsuit accusing the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency of unlawfully depriving asylum seekers access to the U.S. asylum process.

In recent months, Al Otro Lado has sent lawyers to Tijuana to advise members of a Central American migrant caravan that arrived late last year at the Mexican border city. Some of the caravan’s members are seeking asylum in the U.S. Al Otro Lado recently partnered with two members of Congress to escort a group of asylum seekers to the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, where the group waited overnight until Customs and Border Protection officials agreed to accept the migrants for processing.

Phillips, the legal and litigation director for Al Otro Lado, said she was detained Thursday evening after flying to Guadalajara for a planned vacation with her husband and 7-year-old daughter.

Mexican immigration agents scanned her passport and told her it triggered “an alert,” she said.

Phillips said she was separated from her daughter and husband and escorted into a separate room in which Mexican officials peppered her with questions, including about how much money she was carrying, whether she had weapons training, and whether she ever had been arrested or convicted of a crime.

Her daughter was standing just outside the room and started crying. She was allowed to join her mother while the pair were detained for nine hours and had to sleep on a cold floor without food or water, Phillips said. Ultimately, they were turned away and placed on a flight back to Los Angeles.

At a news conference upon her return at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday, Phillips said Mexican officials insinuated that it wasn’t Mexico that had placed the alert. She believes the U.S. government is to blame, although she provided no evidence.

Trump administration officials have repeatedly accused immigration attorneys of coaching migrants to make false asylum claims. In 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions criticized what he called “dirty immigration lawyers who are encouraging their otherwise unlawfully present clients to make false claims of asylum.”

“I think this is retaliation,” Phillips said. “I think this is because we sued the U.S. government. I think it’s that we’re pointing out gross, flagrant human rights violations being committed by the U.S. government, and they don’t like that.”

Pinheiro, the group’s policy and litigation director, said Mexican immigration officials turned her away under similar circumstances Monday as she sought to cross into Tijuana on foot.

Pinheiro, a U.S. citizen who lives in Tijuana, said she was denied the chance to fetch her 10-month-old son, who has dual citizenship and was in Tijuana at the time.

Two journalists who covered the migrant caravan and are not associated with Al Otro Lado described having similar experiences.

Kitra Cahana, a freelance photographer who holds U.S. and Canadian passports, said she was denied entry to Mexico twice in recent weeks.

After flying from Detroit to Mexico City on Jan. 13, she said, Mexican immigration agents detained her at the airport for 13 hours, explaining that her passport had been flagged. She said one official said that when her passport had been scanned, it triggered an Interpol alert. She said the official told her the alert had been triggered by “the Americans.”

Cahana flew back to the U.S. and later flew to Guatemala, where she tried to enter Mexico at a port of entry by foot Jan. 26. She said she was detained for about five hours and was again denied entry.

Cahana, whose work has been published in the New York Times and National Geographic, spent six weeks in Tijuana this winter photographing the caravan.

She spent some of that time at the border, taking pictures of migrants as they sought to cross a fence into the U.S. Cahana said she and other photographers present were occasionally harassed by U.S. Border Patrol agents, who on several occasions took photographs of her and other journalists who were working on the Mexican side of the border.

Cahana said she also once was stopped by a Mexican police officer, who took a photograph of her passport.

She is now waiting on the Guatemalan side of the border, still hoping to access Mexico to continue her work.

“I’m in limbo,” she said. “What kind of list am I on? Who put me on this list? And how many journalists is this affecting?”

Associated Press photographer Daniel Ochoa, a Spanish citizen, said he was denied entry into Mexico as he tried to cross into Tijuana from San Diego on Jan. 20. He was detained for four hours before being turned back.

Like Cahana, Ochoa had photographed members of the migrant caravan, including those who sought to cross the border illegally. He said he too had been photographed by Border Patrol agents and that Mexican police also had taken a photograph of his passport.

Former San Diego U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella, who was a federal prosecutor for some 25 years, said the reports were surprising.

“I’ve never seen it,” LaBella said Friday.

Typically, he said, putting out an alert on someone’s passport through Interpol or a law enforcement agency “usually requires some sort of legal process,” with a judge required to approve the request or charges filed.

Hiroshi Motomura, an immigration law expert and professor at UCLA, said the reports, if true, were troubling.

“I ask the question whether this is a retaliatory move on the part of the government,” he said. “It represents an attempt to interfere with the right to counsel.”","__label__Neutral"
2332,"R. Kelly Charged With 11 New Sex-Related Crimes In Chicago","Prosecutors charged R&amp;B singer R. Kelly on Thursday with 11 new sex-related counts, including some that carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, making them the most serious against him.  Cook County prosecutors charged the Grammy award-winning singer with four counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault, two counts of criminal sexual assault by force, two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, and three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against a victim who was at least age 13 and under 17 at the time, The Chicago Sun-Times reported.  The four aggravated criminal sexual assault counts carry maximum terms of 30 years in prison.  Kelly was already facing 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse involving four women years ago, three of whom were minors when the alleged abuse occurred.  The new charges apparently pertain to a single victim, identified in the court filing by the initials “J.P.” It isn’t clear if she is the same person as one of the initial four accusers who also was identified by the same initials in court documents.  Kelly pleaded not guilty to the original charges and denied any wrongdoing after his February arrest. The AP couldn’t immediately reach him for comment about the new charges.  Kelly’s defense attorney, Steve Greenberg, didn’t immediately respond to an email from the AP seeking comment. He told the Sun-Times that he had received word of new charges from prosecutors but hadn’t seen any filings in the case. He did say he understood that the allegations are “from years ago.”","__label__Neutral"

Annual ExpensesCostco: $126 Amazon Prime: $100 Auto Registrations: $165 Season Tickets: $750 Day One 5:45 a.m. — It's Memorial Day, so there's no alarm to wake up to, but the cats don't seem to have gotten that message. Unsolicited yowling goes on for a while, but I eventually fall back asleep. My husband, B., has likely been up for a while — he has an internal alarm clock that cannot be ignored — but the cats still prefer to torture me. 7:30 a.m. — Up for the day. I snack on a leftover croissant from yesterday's breakfast while B. has a frozen breakfast sandwich. (He nicely waited until I was awake to use the microwave.) I then make some tea and throw together fried rice using leftovers from last night's dinner. I'm not a big fan of traditional breakfast foods and really struggle with breakfast in general, so I tend to eat weird things in the morning. I eat my rice as B. goes to get a propane tank refill and some grill cleaner — we're cooking out later, and although we grill year-round (yes, even in winter in the snow), he still likes doing a “spring cleaning” each year ($59.86). He also gets gas while he's out ($29.89). $89.75 9:40 a.m. — I shower and get ready for the day. Even though it's a holiday, I plan to get in a couple hours of work this morning. Working in operations finance means I don't have a crazy January-to-April tax-type schedule, but instead I have a monthly financial close cycle. I'd compare it to 12 sprints each year versus one marathon. We're heading into the final week of the month, so I figure it's in my best interest to get a bit of a head start. I've noticed that as I've moved up the management chain, more and more of my time is spent in meetings. That doesn't mean all the other work doesn't need to get done — I just have to be more creative about it. B. is still entertaining himself with the grill, so I don't feel too bad about sitting in the office for an hour or two. 11:50 a.m. — Since it's supposed to rain this afternoon, B. grills up the burgers we bought on Saturday for lunch. I do most of the cooking at home, but there are two things I have no interest in — grilling and baking — so B. takes the lead when those occasions present themselves. Add a brioche bun and some pickles, and it's a meal. B. recently rediscovered his love of Bugles, so he has a bag of those as well. 3:30 p.m. — I spend most of the afternoon reading (when B. chooses the TV show) and then watching reruns of Greek, which I found via some digging on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend's Scott Michael Foster (when I get to choose the show). Both cats have dental appointments tomorrow, so we have to feed them early before removing food entirely by 6 p.m. They are thrilled now, but that emotion will soon be replaced as their schedule is thrown off. Neither cat likes the car ride, and one hates the vet entirely while the other is a total weirdo who likes the attention. I always get nervous when either of them go out. We've had bad experiences with teeth cleaning in the past, so I'm hoping it all goes well. B. will be dropping them off and picking them up this time, so I get to avoid the kitty car chorus. 6 p.m. — We watch Jeopardy! together each night as we eat dinner. Yeah, I know: “nerd alert!” Today it's a leftover burger for B. and leftover fried rice for me. It's fun to discover the completely random information we know (How in the world did you know that? How did you NOT know that?). James has been fun to watch, but kind of takes the fun out of the competitive side of the game when he absolutely steamrolls the other two players. I like to blind guess the final question and have actually gotten it right a few times recently! 7 p.m. — I do the dishes and scoop the litter boxes. Our older cat usually gets a special treat each night (to encourage water consumption), but we have to skip that due to their fasting requirements today. Kitty is bummed… 9 p.m. — Take my vitamins and meds, brush my teeth, console the whiny cats, and head to bed. Daily Total: $89.75 Day Two 5 a.m. — Alarm goes off, and I'm up and in the shower. The cats, once again, are not amused with this no-food situation. We have automatic feeders that go off every morning just before 5 to keep them out of our hair as we get ready for work. We turned them off last night, so now the cats are distraught. Oh well! They'll find out why soon enough. I get dressed, throw together my breakfast and lunch, give the kitties an extra cuddle, and wish B. good luck wrangling them to the vet. 6:10 a.m. — I have an incredibly easy commute, with a short 10-minute jaunt along the lake. I'm a morning person and like getting to the office early to knock out a whole bunch of things each day before I start getting sidetracked. I heat up a breakfast biscuit sandwich and eat it while I'm working. 7:30 a.m. — B. calls to confirm the cats have been escorted to the vet. They're apparently the only dental patients of the day, so we should hear any news relatively early on. I ask B. to let me know when he hears something. Like I said…I'm really nervous about teeth cleanings. 11 a.m. — During a break between meetings, I text B. asking if he's heard anything. He says no. No news is good news, right? 12 p.m. — Eat my lunch at my desk. I know, I know, this is something you're not supposed to do. Today I have hummus with carrots and naan, along with some cheese. I also had a Mamma Chia pouch earlier. 1 p.m. — Finally, the all-clear call about both cats! They are fine, no extractions, and they're waking up from the anesthesia. B. will go pick them up around 3. 3:20 p.m. — B. calls while on the way home from the vet. I can hear sad kitty meows in the background. I shut my computer down and head home to meet them. Total damage for two dental exams and cleanings ends up being $793.50. This prompts B. to do some research on pet insurance. The results are inconclusive, and we'll revisit it later. $793.50 3:30 p.m. — I hang out with my two drugged-up cats for a while before dinner. I'll log back on and finish up some work later this evening. I snack on some Fritos while paging through the latest Costco ad. 4:30 p.m. — B. mows the lawn (it's in our marriage contract that I'm required to do no outdoor work) for the third time in the past week. He eats some leftover beef bulgogi and then heads off to his massage appointment. He has a spa day about once a month, and we buy discounted gift cards from Costco. He pays the tip from his own fun money. 5:30 p.m. — My dinner tonight is mango chicken stir-fry. It's pretty tasty, although it makes a mess of my stovetop. Then again, that may speak more to the competencies of the chef… 6 p.m. — Jeopardy!...but alone tonight. Coincidentally enough, I successfully blind guess the final question today, with no witnesses, of course — shout out to SpongeBob! 7:30 p.m. — Clean up in the kitchen and give both cats a special fish treat. Tuna beats salmon in the taste test tonight. 8:15 p.m. — B. returns home from the spa after his 90-minute massage and a bonus spicy-smelling citrus lotion add-on. Not sure I'm a fan – strong scents tend to give me a headache, so we'll see how it goes. 9 p.m. — Meds, litter boxes, teeth, bed. The cats are still kind of loopy, so I'm hoping they settle into bed with us and sleep it off. Daily Total: $793.50 Day Three 5 a.m. — Final day of the kitty-schedule havoc. I split a can of wet food between them, since they're not supposed to eat dry food until tonight. They are supremely uninterested in the food, so I fold pretty easily and give them each a scoop of dry food, too. I figure if it hurts to eat it, they'll stop, right? I hop in the shower, get dressed, and head out to work. 6:15 a.m. — Breakfast today is some fried rice from Costco. I pick out the red peppers because they're slimy and gross. Also, why does the short week after a holiday always feel so strange? I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I make myself a cup today. 11 a.m. — I'm hungry, so I snack on some cheese. Representing well for my fellow Wisconsinites. 12 p.m. — Leftover chicken stir-fry for lunch, along with a Mamma Chia pouch. 4:15 p.m. — I've got a meeting for an organization I'm part of tonight, so I don't have to worry about my own dinner. I'll pop home to feed the cats, though. B. plans to go shooting tonight, so who knows when he'll get home. He recently bought a new handgun (for entertainment, not protection), and he seems to be having a good time. He pays for all that hobby stuff with his fun money. He has a pre-made flatbread pizza to heat up for his dinner later. Tomorrow's our garbage day, so I gather the trash in the house and toss it in our larger bin outside. I'll grab the rest (litter locker and kitchen) when I get home later. Both B. and I are very Type A, so we thrive on schedules, lists, and order. I can't imagine how either of us would survive with someone who was a “fly by the seat of their pants” sort…on the other hand, I'm a terrible procrastinator while he's a “there's no time like the present” crazy person, so we probably still balance each other out in other ways. 5:10 p.m. — With the kitties fed and temporarily content, I head out to my meeting. We each pay $7 at the door, and the chapter covers the balance of the meal costs. I panic when we order and go with the perennial kid favorite of chicken tenders. I do get broccoli instead of fries, though, so I feel a little less childish. $7 8:15 p.m. — As is typical, the meeting goes significantly over its planned end time. I put the group's bill on my credit card (woo, points!), and our treasurer writes me a check. I also pick up some dessert to take home to B. $8.38 8:30 p.m. — Back home, I have dessert with B., and we talk about our days and decompress a bit. I give the cat his nightly treat, and everyone seems to be relieved that things are back to normal. I start to watch the final episode of Fosse/Verdon that I recorded last night, but I'm about five minutes in when B. notices the patio door is crooked. I totally don't see it, but these are the things he zeroes in on and obsesses over. Since he's not the procrastinator in this duo, he immediately gets his tools out and starts taking the door apart (wifely sigh). 9 p.m. — Fosse/Verdon being postponed to a later time, I finish my trash collection from earlier, take the recycling out (they pick it up every other week, and I can never remember which week we're on!), and head to do my nightly bedtime prep — meds, teeth, you know the drill. Daily Total: $15.38 Day Four 5 a.m. — Cats are back to auto-feeding in the morning, praise be! Standard morning routine and off to work. 6:15 a.m. — Breakfast today is a Don Miguel breakfast burrito (yes, from Costco). They're SO MUCH BETTER than the other brands you get at grocery stores — times like these I'm jealous of the West Coast, because it seems like all the various flavors they make are available all over out there, while I'm stuck with the sausage, egg, and cheese version. 11 a.m. — I remember that my nephews are running in a fundraising race this weekend and post a donation link. I was going to wait until I got confirmation that my company was going to match, but I want to get it done, so I log onto the sponsoring foundation's website and do my part. $50 12:15 p.m. — I was on such a roll I almost forgot lunch. Ha. Today is a teriyaki chicken rice bowl. (Costco — man, I feel like a walking ad!) 2:30 p.m. — Tomorrow starts another financial month-end close cycle, so I try to get my house (and my desk) in as much order as I can before I leave for the day. There's something great psychologically about coming into a clean office. 4:20 p.m. — Log off and head home. It's a beautiful day — this is my favorite time of year: sun, decent weather, baby animals — what's not to like? There are lots of boats on the lake, and I even spot a few pelicans. At home I discover that the holiday messed up the garbage-collection schedule, so our bin is still sitting, full, at the end of the driveway. Oops. It will just stay there until they come by tomorrow. Luckily, we're not the only idiots on the block who did that. 5 p.m. — Kitties get fed and I get started on dinner — tonight we're having baked fish (cooked en papillote, with some lemon and snow peas in mine). Surprisingly, that's not what was originally on the docket, but B. decided to request an eleventh-hour swap last night. (We menu plan each Friday for the coming week but always build in some “Plan B” wiggle room.) I also throw the laundry in the washer — when B. gets home, he'll add the clothes he's wearing and turn it on. 6 p.m. — Jeopardy! habit back in action. Then I banish B. to his workshop in the basement so I can finish Fosse/Verdon in peace. It almost works, until the dryer stops and he brings the laundry upstairs to be folded right at the penultimate moment (spoiler alert: Bob dies…). He's always had perfect timing like that. I pause and finish up the laundry. I prefer to do the folding because when B. does it, my stuff ends up all over the place. It's like that “dishwasher loading” concept or whatever. Anyway, I finally finish up the show. If Michelle Williams doesn't get all the awards, the system is obviously rigged. She was fantastic. 8 p.m. — Le chat gets his nightly treat, and I find a random Klondike bar in the freezer so I get a treat, too. As I enter some spending into our money-management program (we use Moneydance), I notice that B. did some impulse shopping on Amazon earlier today and some stroopwafels ended up in his cart ($25.58). I clean out litter boxes and then clean up in the kitchen. There's not enough to run the dishwasher, so I just flip the cutesy magnet to the pig rolling in the mud. $25.58 9 p.m. — Meds, teeth, bed. I don't watch TV in bed, but B. does most nights. He tends to fall asleep no matter what's on, and I eventually hunt the remote down and turn it off. Last night it was some Alaskan gold-hunter/logger/moonshining railroad knife-builder thing (I kid…but seriously, how many of those shows can there possibly be?). Tonight it's baseball. We're deep in Brewers/Packers/Bucks country, so sports are a serious business. This weekend there's the annual Packers charity softball game at the local Class A baseball stadium. Basketball was hot and heavy until last week. It's so engrained in our local culture that it's inescapable, even if you're completely uninvested and uninterested. It's also our #1 stumbling block to cutting the cable cord. Daily Total: $75.58 Day Five 5 a.m. — I'm sorry, being a person with a standard routine makes this part of the diary pretty boring, since I don't have any 24-step skin-care or makeup processes. Honestly, I do very little in that arena. I'm incredibly low-maintenance (and not in a When Harry Met Sally… high-maintenance-but-I-think-I'm-low-maintenance kind of way). I don't even own a hair dryer. I've been using the same hair and face products since high school. I wear only a bit of pressed power to even out my skin tone — once again, the same brand since high school. I have very fair skin, so I do my best to stay out of the sun completely, but if circumstances require it, I wear a big hat and the highest SPF I can find. It works fine for the most part. 6 a.m. — Since garbage collection was pushed back a day, I forget the bin is at the end of the driveway and very nearly plow right into it. Happy Friday! I'm tempted to swing by Starbucks and get a cold brew, but I resist. I instead opt for my breakfast sandwich and some tea. 12:15 p.m. — I'm starving — it's been a crazy morning! I stop for some veggies and hummus along with cheese and then dive back in. That stereotypical introvert “accountant” picture that most people have in their head is totally false. I'd say about 70% of my job is engaging and collaborating with people across the business to dig into data and aid in decision-making. Communication skills, and the ability to make financial information accessible and understandable to non-financial folks, is my job in a nutshell. 3:45 p.m. — I'd say I'm sneaking out early, but I'm salaried and am the senior-most finance person in the building, so that would be overly dramatic. It's another beautiful day — a little warm (80+) and windy — but still not shabby. Annoyingly, I get stuck behind a car with speed-control issues. Most of my drive (95%) is on a winding, two-lane country road surrounded by farm fields. If you get stuck behind an idiot driver (or, more commonly, a piece of farm equipment), you have to just wait it out. I don't care if you drive five miles below the speed limit — just do it consistently so I can set my cruise control and focus on jamming out to my music. Ugh. 4 p.m. — Say hey to the cats and update our money files as I wait for B. to get home — he gets gas on his way ($29.73). We both got paid today, so we're rolling in dough. I transfer the second half of the month's “fun money” and set up some other online payments. B. recently got a raise (and a title change!), so it's exciting to see the higher paycheck amounts. Throughout our entire relationship, I've been the higher earner. It doesn't bother me, but I know it bothers B. sometimes. I feel like I SHOULD be making more than he does — I've got a four-year degree in a sought-after professional discipline with almost two decades of experience, and am solidly in middle management. He has a two-year technical degree in a broad subject area and bounced around a bit in his career development. $29.73 5 p.m. — We're off to our normal Friday night haunt. It's our version of the Cheers bar. They have reasonably priced and adventurous drinks, so we're there probably three out of four Fridays a month. As DINKs (and semi-yuppies — suburban yuppies? Suppies? Oh lord, please don't let that catch on), we prioritize travel and experiences, so that's where a good deal of our discretionary income goes. All the usuals are there, and they greet B. with the universal bro-approved fist bump. I try a sip of the special after B. orders it, and it's not for me, so I go back to my usual drink of choice. We share some snacks, do some socializing, and then call it quits. We go out early and go home early ($80.60). We stop at a local deli/café on the way home since B.'s been craving their lobster roll. I get some chicken salad and an obscenely large brownie ($38.74). $119.34 7 p.m. — We eat dinner as we watch Lip Sync Battle. We don't agree on a lot of shows, but we both love this one. This episode is Jason Schwartzman versus Big Bird. I'm not going to lie — I saw that title and was like “wtf,” but it was AWESOME. Big Bird legitimately kicked Jason's butt, and it was something I never knew I needed to see. We menu plan for the upcoming week and do our weekly “who's got the better credit score?” face-off on Credit Karma. B. wins again. It's ironic, given that when we met his credit was in the toilet, and when we bought our house (12 years ago today! Happy House-iversary!), we bought it in my name because adding him actually hurt us. 9:15 p.m. — We keep to the same basic routine even on non-school nights…meds, litter boxes, teeth, bed. Daily Total: $149.07 Day Six 7 a.m. — I sleep in a bit on Saturdays. B. still gets up relatively early (internal alarm clock and all that), but he goes out to the living room until I get up. When the alarm goes off, I get up, shower, and finalize our shopping list. We keep a notebook in the kitchen where we jot down what we need throughout the week. When we menu plan on Friday, we add those grocery items and whatever else comes to mind. 7:40 a.m. — We usually go out for breakfast on Saturdays, but since we have the Starbucks star challenge, we do our shopping and then stop there on our way back home. We do the majority of our shopping at Walmart. Our list is short this week — we had a monster list last week, as we seem to run out of everything at the same time. We get mouthwash, cheese (three kinds — I seriously feel like a walking WI stereotype), bacon, tortillas, bread, spinach, fruit preserves, ranch dressing, and some mini drumstick cones ($51.33). I also get some Reese's peanut butter cups for my candy bowl at work ($12.14). It's a top-secret accounting trick — lure people into your office with treats, and you can usually get them to stick around and tell you things. $63.47 8:15 a.m. — The line at Starbucks is shockingly short. We use the Starbucks app for all our purchases and are Gold status members until like 2054. Our balance is a bit low, so we load another $100 — we reload about once a month. I rarely go to Starbucks myself, as there's no location convenient between the house and work, but B. stops once or twice a week on his way to work, and we usually go together on the weekend. $100 8:30 a.m. — Unload the groceries, eat breakfast, and watch the rain. We had some loud thunderstorms come through overnight, and it looks like there are two more lines of them that will hit today. That kind of sucks for the charity baseball game this afternoon, but hopefully it will clear out by then. 11 a.m. — My dad and stepmother are coming up for lunch this afternoon. They live about an hour and a half away, and we try and meet up about once a month, alternating who has to do the driving. We'll be out of town for Father's Day, so this is our early celebration lunch. My dad is the master of dad jokes, so the card I got him is full of bad puns that I know he'll love. It's also one of those cards that play music, so that will be fun for all of us in the restaurant. We've picked a gastropub with a menu full of interesting options. One non-negotiable is the candied bacon. B. and my dad have burgers, my stepmother has the salmon special, and I have butternut squash ravioli. It's fabulous, as always. We treat, since we invited them out ($140 including tip). This has been the most interesting part of growing up — the changes in our relationships with our parents. My mom passed away about six years ago, and I continue to miss the opportunity to have seen that relationship evolve as well. $140 1:30 p.m. — After lunch my dad and stepmother stop back at our house so we can coordinate flights for our upcoming family trip. We're meeting everyone else in Montreal, but the four of us will fly together out of the local airport. B. and I book our flights ($1,492.05), and then he helps them get theirs set so we ensure we're on the same plane. We booked the rental car and the Airbnb a couple weeks ago, and everyone else will pay us their portion when we meet up. $1,492.05 2:30 p.m. — We say goodbye to my dad and stepmother. B. decides it's a good time to wash his car, so I spend some time cleaning up in the house and cuddling with the cats. 4 p.m. — After doing some ridiculous six-step wash and detailing thing on his own car, B. decides to mow the lawn and then wash MY car. He is going to be so sore tomorrow. I spend my afternoon watching Always Be My Maybe and Definitely, Maybe (a “Maybe” double feature?) on Netflix. 6 p.m. — I have leftover chicken salad for dinner, and B. snacks on some leftovers from today's lunch that we brought home. Then he heads to bed early because he's pooped. I watch one of my all-time favorite movies, How to Make an American Quilt. I can't even tell you how many times I've seen it at this point. It's so ’90s, though — she makes a mix tape, everyone's smoking. Fabulous cast, if you can ignore Winona Ryder's expressionless acting. 8 p.m. — Kitty gets his treat, and I check on B. to make sure he's still alive. 9 p.m. — Meds, litter boxes, teeth, bed. Daily Total: $1,795.52 Day Seven 6:15 a.m. — Even though Sunday is my day without an alarm (except when we're going to church), apparently my body disregarded that fact and my brain has turned on too much to just lie there. I get up, make some tea, and decide to knock out some work items while I'm motivated. 8:30 a.m. — Put a pause on work and eat my leftovers from yesterday's lunch for breakfast. B. has a breakfast sandwich. I cuddle with the cat while B. watches something with Billy Bob Thornton. (I'm not really paying attention; I'm reading Emily Giffin.) 10:30 a.m. — Disentangle myself from the cat and go take a shower, spending a little extra time shaving (having shed the “winter coat” a few weeks ago). Get dressed and throw the sheets into the washer. B. has migrated to his workshop, so I take control of the TV and watch My Week with Marilyn. Seems like I'm on a Michelle Williams kick. 1 p.m. — B. emerges from the basement to watch the race, so I go back to my chick lit. (We do have multiple TVs in the house, but I figure it's a slippery slope if I leave and go somewhere else every time he watches something I'm not interested in. I don't want a marriage with two people who just happen to live in the same house and say “hi” once a day. I enjoy reading, and it's something I can do while he does something else he enjoys, without us interrupting each other.) He eats the final burger from Monday for lunch while I make some tortilla-crusted tilapia. He then submits to his cookie craving and walks over to the grocery store down the street. $12.49 2:30 p.m. — B. goes back to his workshop — I think he's working on a diamond painting — and I spend some time surfing on Netflix and Prime without really finding anything solid. I watch bits and pieces of a few of my favorites. 5 p.m. — Dinnertime for kitties, but I'm not hungry yet. 6 p.m. — B. emerges with bacon-wrapped scallops from the chest freezer in the basement. He's discovered that cooking them on the grill rather than in the oven is “the bomb.” I eat some leftover chicken salad on one of the extra buns from our burgers on Monday. We both have a mini drumstick (fudge for me, caramel for B.), and then I continue my Emily Giffin book marathon while B. goes back to his show. (He's watching Goliath — I looked up and noticed the title this time. They sure say “fuck” a whole lot.) 8 p.m. — Both cats get a treat on Sundays, because we're cool pet parents. 9 p.m. — Meds, litter boxes, dishwasher, brush my teeth, and get ready to jump into another week.

1536,"We're in Week 2. How long did the longest government shutdown stretch? 21 days - CNN","The U.S. Capitol stands in Washington on Wednesday, Jan. 2, 2019.

We're in Week 2.  How long did the longest government shutdown stretch? 21 days

Updated 1605 GMT (0005 HKT) January 3, 2019

Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.

The partial government shutdown is nearly two weeks old, with no end in sight .

Negotiations between the White House and congressional Democrats to reopen the government are at a standstill. President Donald Trump wants $5 billion for his border wall. Democrats say not a chance.

And so the stalemate continues. That begs the question: what was the longest shutdown in US history?

That would be the 21-day clash between President Bill Clinton and the GOP Congress that stretched from December 1995 to January 1996.

Congressional Republicans clashed with Clinton, a Democrat, over federal spending. The Republicans refused to OK a spending bill because they wanted the Democrats and the White House to, among other things, agree to deep cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.

The GOP also wanted the White House to rely on Congressional Budget Office figures for their budget calculations, which weren't as optimistic as projections from the administration's Office of Management and Budget.

The shutdown ended after 21 full days -- from December 16, 1995 to January 5, 1996. And it did so only after Clinton bowed to a key Republican demand: submitting a seven-year balanced budget plan scored by the Congressional Budget Office.

It wasn't the only shutdown during the Clinton administration. An earlier one lasted five days, from November 14 to November 19, 1995.

The shutdown was clearly blamed on the Republicans , according to polls conducted at the time. The Republicans controlled the House and Senate at the time even though the Democratic Clinton, was in the White House.

Some form of a government shutdown also occurred during other administrations. Here's a look back . And it wasn't always over money. The government has also shut down over abortions and an aircraft carrier .","__label__Neutral"
1874,"Fire in Rockhampton still burning after 10 days","QUEENSLAND Fire and Emergency Services and Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service crews are on scene at a vegetation fire which has been burning at Nankin for 10 days.

The fire is located near Mulgoodoo Rd and Arnold Dr, and fire-fighters are currently strengthening containment lines and will continue to monitor the area throughout the night.

There is no threat to neighbouring properties at this time.

Nearby residents are being encouraged to close their doors and windows to prevent smoke inhalation and keep respiratory medications close by if required.

Queensland Fire media's Dave McLenaghan said over the past 10 days, around 20 crews had been coming and going from the area.

""At 3.30pm Queensland Parks were back on scene and one of the rural crews turned up at 4.30pm,” he said.

""It's contained and they're just patrolling and monitoring it.","__label__Neutral"
1173,"Gov’t to develop model for care of elderly - Wan Azizah","The government is to implement a diagnostic study to develop an integrated and sustainable long-term model for the care of elderly people, Deputy Prime Minister Wan Azizah Wan Ismail said today.
She said the move was aimed at improving and enhancing the National Plan of Action for Older Persons under the National Policy for Older Persons and that the study was necessary because many children neglected their parents due to their work and they themselves were under pressure from their economic well-being and lives.
“We have to look at it comprehensively because it is also wrong to penalise but not solve the problem,” she said after launching Tasputra Perkim, a day-care and training centre for children with disabilities, in Kuala Lumpur.
Earlier, in her speech, Wan Azizah, who is also Women, Family and Community Development Minister, said voluntary welfare organisations were seen as a potent force that could mobilise efforts to improve social well-being in society.
She said the ministry acting alone would be unable to address all issues faced by women, families and the community.
“Smart partnerships with voluntary organisations are one of the most effective methods of implementation.
“We at the ministry always welcome commitment and encourage voluntary welfare organisations and the corporate sector to establish the necessary synergy in implementing the responsibility,” she said.
Wan Azizah said that last year, the ministry, through the Social Welfare Department, spent RM13.67 million on 224 voluntary welfare organisations, including those bodies which operated daycare centres such as Tasputra Perkim.
She said Tasputra Perkim received RM52,200 as allowances for people with disabilities and RM33,132 as grants for children’s food and drinks from the Social Welfare Department.
Wan Azizah said she encouraged the sharing of knowledge to enable voluntary organisations running care centres to learn the best practices for use at their respective centres.
She called on voluntary welfare organisations not to be overly dependent and rely on grants provided by the ministry for their programmes and activities.
She expressed the hope that those organisations that had received the government grants would be able to function on their own with support and aid from the corporate sector and other sources of finance.

1750,"These Cult-Favorite Sneakers Are Now 40 Percent Off","Since its inception in 2004, New York-based footwear brand Common Projects has become something of a cult favorite. The brand makes luxe versions of classic sneaker silhouettes, using premium materials and Italian craftsmanship. While the brand isn’t as hard to come by as it once was, it’s rare to find substantial markdowns on any of its styles.

But, today is one of those rare occasions. If you head over to Mr Porter , you can save 40 percent on a few different pairs of shoes and boots from Common Projects. The understated styles are available in a range of sizes and prices start at $258 — that’s almost unheard of for this brand.

1482,"Coach’s Corner : Manage Your Stress – Balance Your Life","Business and private life has become much faster, more complex and fully global over the last years This puts high pressure on individual work-life balance and well-being as the amount of available information and the high pace of changes creates an environment of permanent stress, what can lead from smaller indispositions to serious diseases.

My name is Claus Breede, I have been with SAP since nearly 20 years. In my main role I lead all virtual, digital and online learning and training for our sales colleagues. In addition, based on my passion and focus for life-balance, I am a mindfulness trainer and coach, facilitating mindfulness trainings at SAP and speaking at events and conferences about Emotional Intelligence and related topics.

Studies and research shows that sickness from stress has accelerated tremendously over the last years. Hence, organizations and individuals need new strategies to cope with stress and to ensure continuous balance, health and wellbeing as the basis for everything in life.

With that in mind, wouldn’t it be great if there was a magic formula to cope with stress, to optimize balance and to finally improve well-being ? – For sure ! However, we cannot assume that there is just one objective general state of well-being (same with stress experience), since it is highly individual and triggered by people’s values, beliefs and experiences as well as preferences and resources. Consequently, what is a good recipe towards better stress-resilience for one person, might not work at all for others. For instance, somebody might be able to bring his/her stress level down by doing extensive sports activities, while somebody else might do meditation in order to relax.

So are we stuck without a solution and just need to accept that the human body, brain and soul is much more under pressure in today’s modern world and it is just the new normal that we suffer? – Probably not, since there are commonalities and certain patterns or aspects that usually need to be considered when talking about improved balance and well-being. How these aspects are being turned into action is highly individual as described above. And the good news is, that even with so much automated reactions and behavior, human beings are able to unlearn aspects of behavior that appear to be not healthy and learn new ways of dealing with stress triggers as well as supporting their own balance. Creating new and healthy mental habits by cultivating certain approaches as well as mental practices seems to be an appropriate part of a working strategy.

And here are three simple ways to do this:

The key in short words is increased self-awareness. Focus more on your reality here and now. This can be practiced by attention trainings, in which you simply sit in silence for some minutes focusing just on your breath. Just doing this for some minutes regularly can change the brain in structure and function so that the increased focus and awareness becomes a normal habit.

Based on step 1 and your ability to be more aware of what happens in your present reality, you can create purposeful pauses instead of immediately reacting to external (from the outside) or internal (what you think) triggers. Do not sit in the backseat of your bus and let others drive, but take back the control and get into the driver seat. In other words, take control of your reactions and emotions, but interrupt this painful chain and take your time to choose a more mindful response to whatever is approaching you. This goes along with your general attitude to things that happen. Be less judgmental and more accepting and cultivate and optimistic mindset.

There are key aspects in life that influence our stress level, how we feel about it, and how far we are able to deal with it. Some main factors are: Nutrition, Sleep, Physical Activity, Social Environment. Make sure that you drink and eat healthy and in accordance with what your body and mind needs. Have enough sleep and avoid stressful and distracting activities in the evening. Balance your body workout between gym, endurance and stretching. Have a look at engagements with other people and use your social environment to provide you energy through positive relations.

Finally, be aware that your body, brain and soul are always closely connected and whatever you do and believe has a strong influence on your life and your well-being. It is your choice to lead the life that you want within the boundaries that you chose. Get started and change for increased balance, better responses to stress and a more healthy and happy life.

A female tramper is recovering in Dunedin Hospital after suffering a broken leg and ankle near Haast this afternoon.

The Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) received an alert from a personal locator beacon at 12.30pm today at Stormwater Bay, near Haast.

Spokesman Mark Dippmer said the woman was part of a two-person tramping party when the incident occurred.

The couple did not have a locator beacon with them, but her male companion was able to flag down a nearby fishing boat, which had a beacon on board.

The crew set off the beacon on behalf of the couple, Mr Dippmer said.

As the beacon was not registered, RCC sent the Otago Rescue Helicopter out of Queenstown to investigate the scene.

The pair were found and a paramedic stabilised the patient, before she was flown to Dunedin.

1957,"Feminist Says Family Must Be “Abolished” to ‘Dismantle Capitalism’","Paul Joseph Watson | Infowars.com - May 17, 2019

Lewis was interview by left-wing website the Nation under the headline Want to Dismantle Capitalism? Abolish the Family .

If by this point, you’re wondering what the hell any of this is about, don’t worry, you’re not alone.

Quite how the family unit is to be ‘abolished’ isn’t explained.

Capitalism and the family unit are two of the bedrocks of western society. As a fringe leftist, it’s unsurprising that Lewis wants to totally obliterate both.

2193,"Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, & Lucy Dacus Tease Collab","Peter Helman @_peterhelman | August 10, 2018 - 11:53 am

Share &lt; br /&gt;this article:

Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker, and Lucy Dacus, three of the most exciting young singer-songwriters in indie rock, are working together. This exciting news first broke last week when Bridgers confirmed the collaboration to journalist Ann Powers during NPR Music’s Turning The Tables Live event in New York, and now a few more details have emerged.

Today, Stereogum received an envelope in the mail containing a publicity photo of the Bridgers, Baker, and Dacus supergroup, the Matador logo, and the word “Boygenius.” So at the very least, the project appears to be called Boygenius, and whatever they’re releasing together, it’ll likely arrive on Matador.

Baker and Dacus are Matador labelmates and have toured together in the past. Baker and Bridgers have also toured together and performed together . Sadly, it seems those bizarre Sims videos of Bridgers, Baker, and Dacus living in a house together are entirely unrelated to their current project.","__label__Positive"
680,"What if New Zealand's War on Wildlife Included Primates?","What if New Zealand's War on Wildlife Included Primates?

New Zealand's current and on-going war on wildlife has the ambitious and rather shameful goal of ridding the country of all non-native invasive nonhuman animals (animals) by 2050. Many of the methods cause horrific pain, suffering and death and millions of sentient and other individual animals are actively targeted not only by adults, but also by youngsters who are ""educated"" to kill these animal beings. New Zealand also legally considers animals to be sentient beings , so most if not all of those people who favor this violent war on other animals likely know there will be inexcusable amounts of pain and suffering. 

I've written many essays about this horrific affront on other animals, and while opinions are divided on this brutal slaughter, it seems like most New Zealanders support it. (See "" Why Is It Wrong to Not Want to Kill Animals? "" and links therein for a summary of what's happening in New Zealand.) Nonetheless, the emails I've received are uniformly against this campaign and many who have written didn't know about it. While there are serious ethical questions that need to be addressed, solid science doesn't also support this program. (See "" Predator Free 2050: A flawed conservation policy displaces higher priorities and better, evidence‐based alternatives "" and references therein.)

I'm writing this brief essay because just this morning, out of the blue while talking with some people about animal protection in general and what's happening in New Zealand more specifically, someone asked a question about which I've never thought, namely, ""What if New Zealand's war on wildlife included invasive non-human primates?"" I asked around and did some checking on the web, and I couldn't find any discussion of this most thoughtful question. Nor could I find much information on examples of invasive nonhuman primates. 

Let's consider the question of the animals who are primarily being targeted in New Zealand along with the question of what if they were nonhuman primates. The animals targeted in New Zealand's bloody campaign are mostly non- charismatic so-called pests such as possums, rats, and stoats. The question concerning the inclusion of non-native non-human primates raises a number of questions that center on the concept of speciesism, generally defined as "" discrimination against or exploitation of certain animal species by human beings, based on an assumption of mankind’s superiority ."" Speciesism involves assigning different values or rights on the basis of species membership, and constructs false boundaries among species. Speciesism also results in animals being classified hierarchically as “lower” and “higher” with humans on the top rung of the ladder.

The speciesist view ignores individual variations in behavior within and between species and hierarchical speciesism results in endless harm and is bad biology. Speciesists also often use such words as ""higher"" and ""lower"" to refer to different groups of animals. But, such words fail to consider the lives and the worlds of the animals themselves. Value judgments also accompany words like ""lower"" and ""higher"" and can result in mistreating individuals who are thought to be lower - not as smart, emotional, good, or valuable - than others based on species membership.

Many people consider New Zealand's pests to be ""lower than"" or ""less valuable than"" nonhuman primates. So too do welfare regulations and laws. (See "" The Animal Welfare Act Claims Rats and Mice Are Not Animals ."") This is a false representation of who these animals truly are, and ignores that they surely don't suffer less than individuals of presumably ""higher"" species.

Furthermore, there's no way that the targeted individuals are going to be killed ""humanely"" with compassion and empathy . Claiming that it's OK to kill millions upon millions of sentient beings as long as it's done humanely ignores the incredible amounts of pain and suffering the vast majority of individuals will endure before dying. There is no way that even a fraction of the animals who are killed using 1080 and other brutal methods will die humanely with compassion and empathy. And, of course, do the animals themselves really care about the humans' kind thoughts and good intentions? (See "" The 'It's OK to Kill Animals Humanely' Apology Doesn't Work ."") All in all, the ""It's OK For Humans to Kill Other Animals if it's Done Humanely"" apology or excuse doesn't really work. It fails millions upon millions of nonhuman animals who die after suffering deep and enduring pain at the hands of humans. 

Some people wonder if ""killing is OK if it's done humanely"" is consistent with the basic guiding principles of  compassionate conservation . It is not, and this view undermines what compassionate conservation is all about. (See also "" Compassionate Conservation: More than 'Welfarism Gone Wild' "" and "" Summoning compassion to address the challenges of conservation ."") Compassionate conservation is based on guiding principles including ""First do no harm"" and the life of each and every individual matters because each has inherent/intrinsic value. So, claiming it's Ok for humans to harm and to kill other animals if it's done humanely ignores their inherent value.

To sum up, it's instructive to ask, ""What if New Zealand's war on wildlife included invasive non-human primates?"" One can also ask the same question if dogs were among the targeted species. Discussing this thought experiment opens the door for exposing how humans view different nonhuman species, if and how speciesism enters into their arguments, and how they come to decisions about who lives, who dies, and why . It also calls attention to the pain, suffering, and death of individual animals. Many conservation biologists play what I call the ""numbers game"" in that if there are lots of representatives of a given species, then it's OK for humans to kill some or allow them to be killed by other species. Individual lives don't really figure into the equation. But, they should, because it's individuals whose pain, suffering, and death truly matter. 

So, would those people who support the wanton and mass killing of non-primates be consistent and argue that non-human primates also should be killed along with the other animals? Some might argue that invasive nonhuman primates might not be as ""predatory"" or otherwise destructive as the other animals who are being targeted, but even if this were true, their presence can alter native populations of animals and different habitats that also need to be preserved along with individuals of native species. (See, for example, "" Invasive primates threaten Atlantic Forest natives "" and "" History and Status of Introduced Non-Human Primate Populations in Florida ."") 

During my discussion this morning, all of the people said they wouldn't want to see invasive primates be killed, some were appalled that other animals were targeted, and some needed to think more on the questions at hand. Fair enough, in that none were researchers or well-versed on the issues at hand. However, we all agreed that our discussion was very useful. I hope other people will debate the issues I raise here, because knowledge about the ways in which people view and treat other animals is critical to their making decisions about what sorts of treatment or interference in their lives, if any, are permissible and why this is so.

It also would be good to hear from youngsters, because they eventually will inherit the world we leave them and the values by which we came to decide the fate of other animals. It's a shame that kids in New Zealand are being taught to and encouraged to kill ""pests"" as part of school-sanctioned events, because the long-term effects of this sort of ""inhumane education "" are extremely troubling. However, slowly but surely, some are speaking out against being told to kill them. (See "" Long-Term Effects of Violence Toward Animals by Youngsters ,"" "" New Zealand Kids Get Into Killing Animals and Love Doing It ,"" "" Why Is It Wrong to Not Want to Kill Animals? "" and links therein.) 

In an increasingly human-dominated world, other animals depend on us for our goodwill and compassion, because we can do whatever we choose to do to them with very few limits on how they are treated if we decide they're disposable for the good of individuals of their own or other species. It's clearly a gross understatement to say that killing other animals needs to be taken very seriously and that mass killing campaigns demand close scrutiny on many different fronts. I hope more and more people will engage in these discussions and debates and those who favor them will change their ways.","__label__Negative"

94,"Modern style Chardonnay shines at 2018 New World Wine Awards","It’s no longer a case of ‘love it or loathe it’ with Chardonnay – the classic but often polarising varietal has staged a comeback at this year’s New World Wine Awards with modern style wines sure to please a wide range of palates.
“While a record number of Rosé wines entered the New World Wines Awards, it was the enduring Chardonnay category that particularly pleased the judges this year,” says Chair of Judges Jim Harré.
Top-ranking Gold medal Chardonnays feature in the hotly anticipated New World Wine Awards ‘Top 50’, which are available in New World stores nationwide from today.
There has been a significant progression in Chardonnay winemaking over the years, and consumers are set to reap the rewards. These winners are all stunning examples of the quality and range of modern style Chardonnay wines that are now climbing back to the top of
Mr Harré says the varietal has moved on from the heavily oaked and buttery Chardonnays of the 1980s, and beyond the pronounced citrus and steely acidity that was prominent in the early 2000s.
“Now, we have well-managed wines that reflect the true quality of the Chardonnay fruit, with a judicious use of oak, and a fine elegance brought about by considered winemaking. They are simply a delight to drink, and a must-try even for those who may not typically
The Wither Hills Marlborough Chardonnay 2017 was selected as the Champion White Wine for the whole competition and is amazing value. The judges noted it as a “superb food wine” and the one “that shows Chardonnay matches nearly anything”.
Other Gold medal-winning Chardonnays include: the Riverby Estate Marlborough Chardonnay 2014, recognised for its beautifully aged characteristics and fruity sweetness; the Sacred Hill Hawke’s Bay Chardonnay 2017 which displays lovely density and texture; and the deliciously tropical Mission Estate Hawke’s Bay Chardonnay 2017 from New Zealand’s oldest winery.
Mr Harré says results like these highlight the real strength of the New World Wine Awards in providing shoppers with trustworthy guidance to help make their next wine purchasing decision.
“The New World Wine Awards has a 16-year track record of connecting wine-lovers with the best quality affordable wines.
“Whether you are looking for a great bottle of your favourite varietal, or would like to try something new, these Gold medal-winning wines are the perfect starting point.”
Mr Harré says consumers can put their confidence in a New World Wine Awards medal thanks to an extremely thorough, three-day judging by 17 independent experts, who together brought more than 250 years of experience to the 2018 competition.
Medal-worthy wines were tasted and re-tasted through blind judging process, meaning judges see only the wine in the glass, no bottles or brands, and are only supplied with the varietal, vintage and country of origin of each wine.
“A Gold medal wine will have been tasted at least 19 times 11 different judges before being awarded this merit. Champion wines will have been tasted at least 36 times! A New World Wine Award Gold medal shows the wine is of the highest standard and shoppers can have absolute confidence in it.”
The New World Wine Awards uses the internationally recognised 100-point system. Under this system, wines are benchmarked and scored against what a perfect wine should be like, rather than against each other.
This means there can be several Gold, Silver and Bronze winners in a category. New World rewards the 50 top-ranked wines with nationwide distribution and promotion to customers.
As a condition of entry, all wines must retail for $25 or less and have a minimum volume available for sale in order to meet consumer demand.

1340,"J.K. Rowling's Quotes About Dumbledore & Grindelwald's Relationship Are ""Incredibly Intense""","Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them has been a controversial follow-up series to the Harry Potter franchise since the premiere. Initially billed as a trilogy focused on a gentle Hufflepuff and his animals, the story turned out to be a prelude to the showdown between Gellert Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore, a story Rowling has revealed in fits and spurts to have been the latter's first great love. However, none of those details have made it on screen or in the books, which is why J.K. Rowling's quotes about Dumbledore and Grindelwald's relationship feel slightly incongruous with the reality of the franchise.
Rowling's has become well known for adding in details about her characters after the fact. Her first revelation after the Potter books ended was that Dumbledore was supposed to be gay. Though she didn't go into detail at the time, she suggested the story between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in their teenage years was a ""love that dare not speak its name"" type trope. It wasn't even clear if it was just Dumbledore having a crush on the young, handsome wizard and Grindelwald manipulating him, or if they both felt this way.
At the time, Rowling thought herself done with the Wizarding World which is why she could drop such details and never worry about having to show them on screen. Now that the new Fantastic Beasts story now revolves around the fallout from that very relationship, Rowling has had to get more explicit.
The latest film, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, did not show any flashback to the teenage relationship between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. The two characters never even appeared on screen together. But as part of the Blu-ray extras , Rowling decided to go full slashfic on unsuspecting viewers and tell them what's not shown.
Their relationship was incredibly intense. It was passionate, and it was a love relationship. But as happens in any relationship, gay or straight or whatever label we want to put on it, one never knows really what the other person is feeling. You can’t know, you can believe you know. So I’m less interested in the sexual side – though I believe there is a sexual dimension to this relationship – than I am in the sense of the emotions they felt for each other, which ultimately is the most fascinating thing about all human relationship.
Rowling has never been great at the sexual side of any of her relationships. Both Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione never share more than a kiss on the page or in the movies/on stage. Also, she has both teenage romances become lifelong marriages, so the idea Dumbledore and Grindelwald are still not over each other decades later is at least in keeping with her simplistic ""teenage relationships are forever"" view of the Wizarding World.
It's this fact which has made the Potter universe such a rich and fertile ground for fanfiction (and slash fiction) over the years. So while fans may be frustrated by the lack of any Dumbledore/Grindelwald action on screen, Potter fic writers can keep doing what you're doing. It's most likely the only action Fantastic Beasts fans will ever see in this department.","__label__Neutral"
1619,"How young is too young for the measles vaccine?","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that the first measles, mumps and rubella shot be administered between 12 and 15 months, but worried moms and dads want it sooner. The second dose is usually given at 4 to 6 years old, before kids start school.

Mary Beth Koslap-Petraco, a nurse practitioner, adjunct clinical assistant professor at Stony Brook School of Nursing and consultant with the Immunization Action Coalition, says newborns have passive immunity from their vaccinated mothers until the age of about six months, but “it is not long-lasting and wears off over time.”

The shot is already recommended for infants over six months of age who are traveling outside of the US. The two doses must be given at least 28 days apart and both can be given early, particularly for children who live and play where there are outbreaks or a large number of unvaccinated people.

“It’s very safe,” adds Koslap-Petraco, who says insurance companies might push back against covering the cost of an early MMR dose but would likely pay up on appeal.","__label__Neutral"

Prime Minister Netanyahu gave a bold speech at the United Nations yesterday–may Hashem bless him and all the protectors of the Holy Land.

In the speech, Netanyahu reaffirmed the special friendship and alliance between the United States and Israel. He also called out the terrorists and their sponsors, the enemies of peace: Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas.

Netanyahu once again disclosed to the world the complete sham and disgraceful Nuke Deal with Iran of 2015. Following up the prior disclosures of Israel’s incredible raid that netted over 100,000 pages detailing Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions and program, yesterday Netanyahu now revealed a secret Iranian nuke facility site hidden inside a rug-cleaning warehouse right inside Tehran (Netanyahu even gave the address).

He encouraged the IAEA to do their job, inspect the site immediately, and disclose the illicit and dangerous WMD activities by Iran. Despite the Iran deal, it is incredible that just inside this one Iranian nuke facility are 15 shipping containers of secret Iranian equipment and material–that’s over 300 tons worth! Netanyahu also revealed 3 secret missile sites in Beirut, Lebanon, right around their international airport, continuing the terrorist trend of using civilians as shields.

As Iran continues to develop its nuclear weapons program and sponsor terrorism around the globe, as PM Netanyahu promised, Israel and the U.S. are on to them, and they will not let it happen!  A little more than 70-years after the Holocaust that murdered 6,000,000 Jews, Iran will not be allowed to pose an existential threat to Israel and a danger to the entire world.

Let’s hope that peace can prevail and that the good people of Iran will be able to take back their country soon from the tyrannical and repressive regime. The alternative is that Netanyahu’s blowout of Iran yesterday at the U.N. General Assembly will end up being just a prelude to a genuine blowout of the Iranian nuclear weapons facilities themselves.

270,"Michael Hill Dec qtr sales fall 1.3% despite Christmas boost","Jan. 16 (BusinessDesk) - Michael Hill International reported a 1.3 percent decline in December quarter sales, with only its Canadian business reporting improved sales in the key pre-Christmas period.
The jeweller’s latest update shows that November and December sales from continuing operations increased 2.9 percent from a year earlier, and were up 1.3 percent on a same-store basis.
But those gains were led by a 10.5 percent improvement in its Canadian sales – the firm’s second-largest market. Pre-Christmas sales in Australia, where it gets more than half its revenue, fell 1 percent, while New Zealand sales were down 1.6 percent.
Quarterly group sales from continuing operations were down 1.3 percent, and down 2.9 percent on a same-store basis. For the half-year, sales fell 4.2 percent to A$309.5 million and were 6 percent lower at A$292.7 million on a same-store basis.
Gross margins for the half held up at 62.7 percent, despite increased costs caused by a weaker Australian dollar, the company said.
Chief executive Daniel Bracken acknowledged that, despite the “significant” improvement since the first-quarter, the company had more work to do to strengthen the business and evolve its strategy.
“The company’s performance during the key November and December trading period was encouraging,” he said in a statement to NZX. “A refined approach to our event and promotional activities resulted in a lift in sales during our two busiest months. This was a good outcome in a challenging retail environment.”
Michael Hill shares last traded at 64 cents, having fallen about 52 percent during the past year.
Bracken, who only joined the Brisbane-based firm in November, is rebuilding his executive team as he implements a new strategy which was started last year to reposition Michael Hill as a “differentiated” multi-channel brand.
The company shut its decade-old US chain last year, is closing down its three-year-old Emma &amp; Roe business, and is focusing more on on-line sales and proprietary, branded products.
Today the company said e-commerce sales at A$8.1 million were 59 percent higher than a year earlier and accounted for 2.6 percent of group half-year sales.
Branded collection sales were 11 percent higher and accounted for 20 percent of half-year group sales, up from 18 percent last year.
Today’s report shows December quarter sales in Australia fell to A$106.9 million, down 4.6 percent from a year earlier. They were down 7 percent for the half-year at A$172 million.
New Zealand quarterly sales were down 4.8 percent at NZ$41.8 million, and 5.9 percent lower for the half-year at NZ$65.6 million.
Canadian sales increased by 4.5 percent to C$49 million in the December quarter, leaving them 0.3 percent ahead at C$72.9 million for the half-year.
The firm said it had 309 Michael Hill stores at Dec. 31, having opened six new stores and shut three that were under-performing in the half.
It shut four Emma &amp; Roe stores in the September quarter. Two stores and the website continue operating while their closure is negotiated with landlords.
On a same-store basis, those outlets delivered A$3.7 million of sales in the half-year, up 6.5 percent from the year before.","__label__Neutral"
1467,"Accusations of ""Invasive Species Denialism"" Are Flawed","Researchers accused of denying the effects of invasives aren't really doing so.

""In New Zealand there are a few introduced predators that hunt native wildlife and put them at risk of extinction. Most New Zealanders would like to protect those native species. However, rather than focus on the myriad of ways in which native wildlife might be protected and persist, New Zealand has adopted a narrowly focused policy of exterminating the predators that eat them."" 

A hot topic among conservation scientists, specifically researchers called  invasion biologists , centers on the presence of invasive species , typically referred to as species that are non-native to a particular ecosystem, individuals of which often cause harm to native species or the ecosystem, or which have negative effects on the economy of a given region or on human health . Numerous introduced species wind up in a particular locale because humans have brought them there either intentionally or inadvertently, a point that often is overlooked in programs designed to get rid of them. An excellent case is New Zealand's widespread and rather brutal war on invasive wildlife , the goal of which is to rid the country of invasive species by 2050. Not only are adults involved in this war, but so too are youngsters who are inhumanely educated to kill invasive animals in school sanctioned activities . (For more details click  here and here .) Not everyone agrees that invasive species are doing all the damage for which they're accused, and surely, even if individuals of non-native species are removed, ecosystems are not going to go back to what they were before the invasives were there, because ecosystems are dynamic entities that evolve according to who is there. 

It's also interesting to note that although New Zealand has officially recognized nonhuman animals (animals) as sentient beings , the methods that are used surely will cause deep and enduring pain and suffering leading to the death of millions upon millions of sentient beings. There's no way that the vast majority of animals who are killed are going to be killed in any way that resembles ""humane."" Some people have gone as far as to call it a cop-out, because it's difficult to imagine that anyone who claims that the victims will be killed humanely can truly believe this given what we know about the horrific ways in which these individuals are harmed and killed. There's no way that even a fraction of the animals who are killed using 1080 and other brutal methods will die humanely with compassion and empathy. And, of course, do they really care about the humans' kind thoughts? (See ""Is Killing Introduced Predators 'Absolutely Necessary? '"" and links therein.) As  Dr. Jamie Steer notes , ""We can't just throw them under the bus and say 'We did like you back in the 1800s, but now it turns out you're not useful to us any more and you contradict things that we find useful. So we're just going to kill you all. But don't worry - we're going to do it nicely'.""

The rapidly growing and strongly transdisciplinary field of compassionate conservation  (for more information click here ) surely could help reduce the killing that is currently going on and will continue in the years to come in New Zealand and other places. (See "" Summoning compassion to address the challenges of conservation "" and "" Promoting predators and compassionate conservation. "") Interestingly, a self-serving and uninformed essay by Dr. Peter Fleming, a self-proclaimed ""lower case compassionate conservationist (i.e. a conservationist with compassion)"" with the catchy title "" Compassionate conservation or misplaced compassion? "" published by Australia's Invasive Species Council , thoroughly misrepresents the field of compassionate conservation. (See "" Compassionate Conservation Isn't Veiled Animal Liberation. "") The entire tone of his piece reeks of unbridled anthropocentrism because according to him, while nonhuman animals shouldn't be killing individuals of other animal species, it's perfectly okay for humans to do this. He doesn't argue this view, but rather, he simply states it as if it's doctrine. While progress will only be made when all voices are heard, it's not asking too much to expect them to be informed about what they're arguing for or against. Dr. Fleming is not.

Needless to say, researchers disagree on the effects of invasive species and many get pretty ""hot under the collar"" especially when other scientists or informed non-scientists disagree with them about the role that invasive species play in harming individuals of other species or in influencing the integrity of different ecosystems. Often, the naysayers are accused of denying the impact that invasive species have on other species or on various ecosystems. I've always felt uneasy about these accusations, so I was very pleased to learn of a new essay by New Zealand researchers David Munro, Jamie Steer, and Wayne Linklater titled "" On allegations of invasive species denialism "" that is in press in the prestigious journal Conservation Biology. In the abstract of this seminal piece Mr. Munro and his colleagues write, ""Recently, 67 scholars, scientists and science writers were accused of ‘invasive species denialism’ (ISD) – the rejection of well‐supported facts about invasive species, particularly the global scientific consensus about their negative impacts. We re‐evaluated the ISD literature but could find no examples where scientific facts were refuted and just five articles with text perhaps consistent with one of the five characteristics of science denialism."" Having been accused of ""‘invasive species denialism,"" I wanted to learn more about what these researchers did, so I asked if they could answer a few questions about their essay. Gladly, they said ""Yes,"" and our interview went as follows.

I was so pleased to read your essay in Conservation Biology titled ""On allegations of invasive species denialism."" Why did you write it? Can you also briefly introduce readers to the field called Invasion biology and the current situation about New Zealand's war on invasive species? 

""We think recent articles claiming science denialism with regards to invasive species fall into the same pattern of ‘them and us’ rhetoric and practice in science. They turn the conservationists’ ‘war’ against some species into a war-like debate between invasion biologists and other people. We think this kind of debate is intolerant and counter to good scientific practice.""

David: We were surprised to read in 2017 of a growing debate around the concept of ‘invasive species denialism’. This concept seemed a counter-productive development in the professional and public debate about invasive species. And we were shocked to see that this debate had degenerated into name-and- shame style publications. We felt that the idea and practice therefore needed to be challenged. For scientists and a science journal to publish a name-and-shame list of alleged science deniers seemed unethical to us. And knowing some of the work labelled as science denialism, we immediately suspected that some works and people being accused were anything but science denialists.

Invasion biology is one of several scientific disciplines contributing to the conservation of natural systems and biodiversity. It has grown in importance because the movement of other species by people around the world has increased how often a small subset of those species cause problems. It is a discipline that could draw deeply from other natural sciences, especially ecology, but also increasingly the social sciences because conservation depends on, and addresses, the positive and negative relationships between people and natural systems and their plants and animals.

A big part of conservation in New Zealand is concerned with controlling or eliminating introduced ‘invasive’ species. Conservation in the country is frequently presented in war-like terms employing ‘them and us’ dichotomies and in and out groups to unify people behind a common purpose. Our concern is that this rhetoric is also being adopted by some scientists in invasion biology. We think recent articles claiming science denialism with regards to invasive species fall into the same pattern of ‘them and us’ rhetoric and practice in science. They turn the conservationists’ ‘war’ against some species into a war-like debate between invasion biologists and other people. We think this kind of debate is intolerant and counter to good scientific practice.

I know that many researchers consider it a 'fact' that invasive species cause harm, however, you conclude that you found no evidence of ""invasive species denialism‟(ISD) in your review of pertinent literature. How and why do the accusers come to their conclusion, and why is it perpetuated among researchers who supposedly know how to summarize available data. Non-researchers surely expect that researchers would agree about what data show when analyzing the same data set and that researchers would freely share data sets among them. However, you found this wasn't the case and that there is some sort of taboo – silence – among researchers.

Jamie: The alleged denialists are contesting invasion biology’s values-consensus, not its science consensus. This has happened because invasion biology as a science has fashioned and defined itself, more than many other applied sciences, using normative beliefs rather than values-neutral and scientifically defendable criteria. This has opened the discipline up to legitimate critique from many directions. Some invasion biologists have not been able to recognise or acknowledge this. And so when their discipline has been criticised they have misinterpreted it as a criticism of science. Instead it is generally a criticism of the values that define the discipline and the values that the discipline imposes on others by stipulating how they should value particular species of plants and animals (i.e., by describing them as universally ‘harmful’). Values are integral to science. Appreciating and being transparent about that is key to better science. But when scientists are opaque or intransigent about their values – like invasion biologists can sometimes be – further criticism will naturally follow. The issue over data sharing – or rather not sharing in this case – is characteristic of the oppositional approach that some are taking (i.e., I’ll share my data with you, but only if I can trust that you’ll interpret it the ‘right’ way).    

Related to the above question, you also write that there is apparent censorship by some researchers when others propose ideas that aren't consistent with their own. You write, ""Bold new ideas are often forced to publish outside the scrutiny of scientific peer review as they may be considered too different to established knowledge to pass through the often conservative lens of established science."" Some colleagues and I experienced this when I began writing about the emotional lives of animals, and it took some time for things to change. 

Wayne: I think all researchers, especially if they are working at the limits of knowledge and understanding , will inevitably run into the conservatism of science and struggle to get their work published. New ideas – even good and important ones – take time to be accepted. The first times those new and unconventional ideas are written and submitted for publication to peer-reviewed journals they are more likely to receive negative reports from reviewers and less likely to be supported by editors. And so, very often, the ideas that advance our knowledge and understanding end up appearing in print for the first time outside the realms of scientific peer-review. As scientists we have to appreciate that and respect the important roles of unconventional and unacceptable discovery expressed in less reviewed literature alongside, and as a complement to, conservative peer-review publishing. When scientists denigrate the work of scholars in formats that are not peer-reviewed they forget how knowledge develops and is advanced.

I find it surprising that some scientists consider researchers who take the opposite view from theirs to be anti-science. My non-researcher  friends often tell me that they believe science is value-neutral and trust that there is some ""truth"" to how data are interpreted. Why do facts and values conflict in general, and more specifically in the case of what's happening in New Zealand? 

David: Wayne’s response to your second question covers some of this answer. Please refer to it too. In addition to this, values have always been and always will have a part in science. In fact, it seems that values influence science at least as much as science influences values, if not more so. It is not possible for science to be values-free. And we wouldn’t want it to be because very much science is motivated by scientists’ desire to help others. That said, invasion biology has been extraordinary in its relationship with values in two ways:

1.      Invasive species are defined by cultural value-judgements, much more so than other species definitions in conservation.

2.      Invasion biologists habitually do not recognize or debate those value judgements.

This is why they can make the mistake of interpreting critique of their value judgements as a critique of their science when it is not. Thus, invasion biology is naïve about its values whereas many other similar sciences are fully engaged with their values, transparent about them, and readily debate them as such.

In New Zealand there are a few introduced predators that hunt native wildlife and put them at risk of extinction. Most New Zealanders would like to protect those native species. However, rather than focus on the myriad of ways in which native wildlife might be protected and persist, New Zealand has adopted a narrowly focused policy of exterminating the predators that eat them. This has occurred partly because the science of invasion biology, its values-based consensus, and the ‘them and us’ politics that it encourages, has had a stronger influence in conservation than more moderate and nuanced solutions. As a consequence, solutions to the challenge posed by introduced predators have not drawn as deeply as they should from the natural and social sciences and run headlong into ethically questionable strategies, like nationwide species eradication.

You also mention that it's important to have input from non-scientists, something with which I strongly agree. Why is this so?

""In my experience, there is a certain arrogance among those of this latter stripe. I think sometimes scientists become so accustomed to seeing themselves as the impartial gatekeepers of knowledge – so used to pointing to the errors in others logic – that they struggle to function when tested on their own value assumptions. After all, how could they, the masters of knowledge, get it wrong?""

Jamie: Because science is values-driven it benefits from constant dialogue with the disciplines that specialize in the interface between values and knowledge. Most scientists recognize this of course. It’s one of the reasons why they increasingly seek popular avenues like magazines, newspapers and blogs to present their research – to reach out to that wider audience. That’s not just an opportunity to tell people about the facts either. It’s a way of testing the clarity and resonance of their work. Not all see it this way though and, truth be told, a few still see interactions with non-scientists as a chore. 

In my experience, there is a certain arrogance among those of this latter stripe. I think sometimes scientists become so accustomed to seeing themselves as the impartial gatekeepers of knowledge – so used to pointing to the errors in others logic – that they struggle to function when tested on their own value assumptions. After all, how could they, the masters of knowledge, get it wrong? It contradicts their personal narrative. This can be particularly confronting when the assumptions in question are integral to their science. The response from this set is often to erect walls around their facts: these facts are important and those aren’t. And those who contest this are simply in ‘denial’. 

I think a better approach is to be open to differences in values and priorities. As a scientist, the only way to do that is to be up front about what you hold dear and transparent about how you deal with your personal biases. In truth, it’s not as straightforward as that though is it, because when everyone shares the same kind of bias it’s often seen not as bias but as virtue. When you sincerely believe your prejudice to be virtuous you may lose the ability to recognize it at all.      

In your essay you write, ""Tolerance of different perspectives is a quality widely valued in open societies, including scientific communities. In science we accept that a diversity of perspectives is an advantage, not a problem. It is also an ethical imperative because including minority views in our scientific institutions is an expectation of modern science (White et al. 2018). The intolerance by some invasion biologists of different perspectives, made manifest in fallacious accusations of science denialism, is problematic."" I couldn't agree more. Do you have faith that the ""name and shame"" way of criticizing so-called ""denialists"" will change any time soon? 

Wayne: I hope that ours and other published responses to this name-and-shame style of discourse discourage more of it. Unfortunately, we see other colleagues making use of the allegation of invasive species science denialism in other conservation topics, such as the controversy over domestic cats . Some have called the people and groups who advocate for cats and cat owners ‘invasive species denialists’ too. This will not help them reach a solution to the conservation challenge posed by domestic cats. They should instead be prepared to engage with a values-based discussion with cat advocates in ways that are conciliatory and respectful of others values and beliefs.

My impression is that the antagonistic behaviour of some invasion biologists calling others ‘science denialists’ is symptomatic of deep flaws in the science of invasion biology. More than other applied sciences, invasion biology is based on a cultural framework that some of its practitioners are unable or unwilling to acknowledge, examine and debate. And so they misinterpret critique of their values as science denial. Some introspection by invasion biologists about their values and culture, and reflection on others’ values and cultures, would be helpful and revealing I think. I also suspect that invasion biology would do well to deepen its relationship with the science of ecology, and with the social sciences that are more transparent about their values-frameworks, but also more guided by open-minded discovery. 

Is there anything else you would like to tell readers?

""In New Zealand, flawed policies to exterminate entire species from our nation are revealing just how important it is that psychology, sociology, history and ethics , as a few examples, take a greater role in environmental debate and policy.""

David: I hope that through our paper people will become more aware of, and able to identify, when arguments are founded in values rather than science. Illuminating so-called ‘denialists’ is only useful when the accused are in-fact denying objective evidence. In these post-truth times it is important to remain vigilant in the face of orchestrated science denial, but we should not let this extend into the suppression of alternative values as has unfortunately been occurring in invasion biology.

Wayne: In conservation science we are increasingly appreciating the importance of the social sciences and humanities in providing solutions to long-standing, pressing and growing environmental challenges. In New Zealand, flawed policies to exterminate entire species from our nation are revealing just how important it is that psychology, sociology, history and ethics, as a few examples, take a greater role in environmental debate and policy. But it is also revealing how poor the relationships between even the natural sciences, like ecology, and government policy-making are. It’s really very important that we scientists take a greater role in informing government policy.

Thank you very much for taking the time to answer these questions. I hope your essay receives a wide readership, not only by people interested in invasion biology, but also by researchers in other disciplines. What you write in your piece captures the essence and importance of your study, namely, ""A key recommendation is that invasion biology could avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and conflicts by being more accepting of perspectives originating from other disciplines, and more open to values‐based critique from other scholars and scientists. This recommendation applies to all conservation sciences, especially those addressing global challenges, because they must serve and be relevant to communities with an extraordinary diversity of cultures and values."" Another case in point that also focuses on the diversity of cultures and values is what is happening in Southern Africa in different conservation's throughout the region and what people call ""The Nature/Culture Cocktail."" (See "" Sentience and Conservation: Lessons from Southern Africa. "") I look forward to future discussions of the many points you make in your seminal piece.","__label__Neutral"
2616,"Jose Mourinho ready to try yet another midfielder at CB in experimental Manchester United XI vs Newcastle","Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho is reportedly ready to try another experimental XI against Newcastle this weekend.
The Red Devils boss really needs to get things right after his side’s recent struggles, which have seen them go on a run of four games in all competitions without a single win.
Mourinho’s side host Newcastle at Old Trafford this weekend and the Metro claim Mourinho is preparing to line up in a 3-4-3 formation for the visit of the Magpies.
The Portuguese tactician is said to be thinking of using midfielder Nemanja Matic in a back three, having already experimented with Ander Herrera and Scott McTominay in defence this season.
On both occasions that backfired massively as United conceded three goals against Tottenham and then against West Ham.
Still, the Metro claim Mourinho thinks Matic’s ball-playing ability in that role could mean he’s a better option, with Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly also in line to start at the back.
Elsewhere, the Metro report that United will use an attack-minded front three of Alexis Sanchez, Marcus Rashford and Romelu Lukaku, while it could be a partnership of Paul Pogba and either Fred or Juan Mata in the centre.","__label__Neutral"
2680,"Unprecedented rise in South Island ocean temperatures","As the country grapples with some of the hottest weather on record , new research has found ocean temperatures around the South Island are also reaching unprecedented levels.
New Zealand, Australian and US scientists have just published a study on last summer's heatwave, finding sea water temperatures around the South Island turned almost sub-tropical.
The Tasman Sea warmed on average by 3.7C above normal to reach 20.6C, with fish normally found in the tropics straying further south than they are supposed to.
University of Otago physical oceanographer Dr Robert Smith said while this may be good for recreational fishers, it pointed to the disruption of ecosystems that could be devastating to some species.
""Reports started coming in over summer from local fishermen. On average over the last 10 years they've caught one or two kingfish per summer season.
Kelp forests along Otago's coastline, which provide habitat, food and nursery grounds for fish and species dwelling on the sea floor, were also unusually absent last summer.
""If you were a surfer, you could wear board shorts instead of a wetsuit in Dunedin - almost unheard of - with sea temperatures around the 20-21 degree mark at St Clair.
The study found that the heat wave was driven by the dual effects of warm atmospheric air and low wind speeds, which would usually have a cooling effect on the sea.
Dr Smith said a parallel study carried out by Australian-based scientists showed last year's marine heat wave would likely not have happened without man-made influence.
Should conditions be at all like they were last summer - as they appear well on track to be - sea temperatures could rise further.
""This is what some children today can expect to see in their lifetimes,"" Dr Smith said.
The study, just published online in Environmental Research Letters, found the summer of 2017-2018 heat wave was the most intense on record when it came to ocean temperatures.
The New Zealand, Australian and US collaborative study was led by climate scientist Jim Salinger, and involved scientists from Otago's Marine Science, Geography and Surveying Departments, as well as from Victoria University and the National Institute of Weather and Atmospheric Research (NIWA).
It used data sets by scientists from Victoria University of Wellington, NIWA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency, the University of Otago and the University of New South Wales.","__label__Neutral"

The vegetarian protein company has released a new version of its industry-upsetting burger, which it says looks, tastes and cooks more like beef than the original Beyond Burger.

The new “meatier” patty has marbling that “melts and tenderizes just like beef” and uses apple extract to help deepen the brown color to better resemble hamburger meat, according to the press release.

The new formula uses coconut oil and cocoa butter for a juicier mouthfeel and a blend of pea, mung bean and rice proteins to give it a more fibrous texture.

The vegetarian meat company, which has blown up in the last few months, has been pushing toward offering a plant-friendly option that mimic meat so closely, people won’t know it’s not beef.

The meatier product started its rollout on Monday and will be in all stores nationwide by the end of the June — just in time for weekend cookouts.

537,"NYPD probes commander who allegedly told cops to shoot 50 Cent","The NYPD is investigating the behavior of a Brooklyn precinct commanding officer who allegedly told his officers to “shoot” 50 Cent — and the rapper announced publicly on Sunday that he was never notified by police about the threats against him.

Deputy Inspector Emanuel Gonzalez, commanding officer of Sunset Park’s 72nd Precinct, allegedly told officers during roll call that if they see the rapper they should “shoot him on sight,” police sources said.

Gonzalez gave his cops the message on June 7 — the same day as the Bronx Smoker, where Fiddy was headed to watch cops who have beefs with each other duke it out.

The rapper, whose real name is Curtis James, posted a series of photos to Instagram on Sunday, and said he was never made aware of the threat against him.

“I take this threat very seriously and im consulting with my legal counsel regarding my options moving forward,” he wrote in one of Sunday’s three posts to his account. “I am concerned that I was not previously advised of this threat by the NYPD. #NYnotSafe#TheGangstagotabadge”

A different Instagram post features Gonzalez’s NYPD photo.

“This is Emanuel Gonzalez commanding officer of the 72percinct [s.i.c.]. He think he got beef with me,so he sending the Homies to put some work in. NYNOTSAFE #thegangstagotabadge”

The Brooklyn boss and the rapper have had beef of their own ever since Gonzalez tried to squeeze the owner of hip-hop club Love &amp; Lust for gifts.

The club owner, Imran Jairam, claimed the cops and State Liquor Authority “unfairly targeted” the club when he didn’t give Gonzalez what he’d requested.

Fiddy then appeared to threaten the Brooklyn boss in a since-deleted Instagram post in May, writing “Get the strap” — his token catchphrase, which he attaches to social media postings nearly daily. “Strap” is slang for gun.

“They trying to shut him down,” the rapper also posted to Instagram, referring to Jairam.

After the Post exclusively reported NYPD’s investigation into the rapper, Fiddy again took to Instagram , where he posted a picture of his application to trademark the catchphrase.

“So here’s the trademark, investigation over,” he wrote of the application, taunting the NYPD, “Back to fight crime alright guys. Get the strap.”","__label__Neutral"

813,"FBI probes theft, crashing of plane by US airline worker","Federal authorities on Saturday were seeking to learn what drove an airline worker to steal an empty aeroplane from Seattle's airport in a security scare that caused the scrambling of US fighter jets and ended when the plane crashed onto a sparsely populated island.

A Horizon Air ground service agent got into a Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft on Friday night in a maintenance area at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and took off, Horizon sister carrier Alaska Airlines said.

He flew for about one hour, often erratically with attempts at aerial stunts, before crashing on Ketron Island in Puget Sound, some 25 miles (40 km) to the southwest.

The 29-year-old man, who has not been officially identified, was suicidal and appeared to have acted alone, according to authorities. He was believed to have been killed in the crash.

Citing co-workers and relatives, local news media named the man as Richard Russell of Sumner, Washington.

He was not known to have had a pilot's license, Horizon Air Chief Executive Gary Beck said at a news conference, and it was not clear how he was able to take off and fly like he did.

""There were some manoeuvres that were done that were incredible manoeuvres with the aircraft,"" Beck said. ""Commercial aircraft are complex machines. They're not as easy to fly as, say, a Cessna 150, so I don't know how he achieved the experience that he did,"" Beck said.

The local sheriff's department said on Twitter that either doing stunts ""or lack of flying skills"" caused the crash.

In partial recordings of Russell's conversations with air traffic controllers that were published online by Broadcastify.com, he said he was sorry to disappoint people who cared about him and described himself as a ""broken guy.""

""Got a few screws loose, I guess,"" Russell is heard saying in the recording. ""Never really knew it until now.""

He also admired the sunset, complained of lightheadedness, and asked whether he would go to prison if he landed safely.

He had worked for Horizon Air for 3-1/2 years and had clearance to tow planes, Alaska Airlines Chief Executive Brad Tilden said at the news conference.

Tilden said aeroplanes of that type do not have doors that lock or ignition keys like cars.

""The setup in aviation in America is we secure the airfield and then we have the mindset that we have employees that are credentialed and authorized to be there,"" Tilden said, adding that the airline was working with authorities to investigate.

The FBI is leading the probe, which also includes the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board.

""We are going to be thorough, which means taking the time needed to scour the area, delve into the background of the individual believed responsible, and review every aspect of this incident with all appropriate public &amp; private partners,"" the FBI said in a statement.

Two F-15 fighter jets took to the air from a base in Portland, Oregon, and were on the scene within minutes. The jets were armed but did not open fire, North American Aerospace Defence Command spokesperson Cameron Hillier said by phone.

Instead, the F-15 pilots and air traffic controllers tried to guide the plane west, away from populated areas, said Hillier. No one was hurt on the ground, authorities said.

It was unclear how the employee was able to taxi the plane on a runway and take off without authorisation.

The Bombardier Q400 turboprop is designed for short-distance flights and can seat 76 passengers, Alaska Air said.","__label__Neutral"
263,"Symantec Delivers Complete Endpoint Defense","New endpoint security offerings now available as part of Symantec’s Integrated Cyber Defense Platform AUCKLAND, 30 January 2019 – Symantec Corp. (NASDAQ: SYMC), the world’s leading cyber security company, today announced new innovations and enhancements to its endpoint security portfolio designed to defend against the most sophisticated cyber attacks through advanced endpoint protection and hardening capabilities. These new offerings will help customers reduce the endpoint attack surface by allowing only known good applications to run, enhancing application discovery and risk assessment, and preventing stealthy attacks.
Traditional endpoint security is effective at stopping malware, but sophisticated attackers are increasingly taking advantage of the complexity of endpoint environments, exploiting gaps to discover new paths to lucrative targets.    “The diversity and complexity of today’s heterogeneous endpoint environment creates multiple opportunities for cyber-attacks,” said Fernando Montenegro, Senior Analyst – Information Security, 451 Research. “The deployment of endpoint security software that brings together not only prevention and endpoint defense and response, but also hardening technologies to further reduce the attack surface is more important than ever.”
To address these challenges, Symantec incorporated advanced protection and hardening into its market-leading endpoint security solution which delivers a coordinated, adaptive endpoint defense that is simple for security teams to manage. This defense framework reduces the attack surface and delivers protection from unauthorised access, known vulnerabilities, zero-day attacks, and everything in between. Symantec delivers these technologies through a single agent which is managed by an integrated cloud console, lowering deployment and management complexity.
Endpoint security portfolio updates include: Symantec Endpoint Application Control defends against advanced attacks by only allowing known, good applications to run, thus minimising the attack surface. The industry-leading whitelisting solution includes smart, auto-generation of application-specific rules, comprehensive application discovery, in-depth risk assessment, and continuous tracking of application drift – making it easy to deploy and manage in dynamic endpoint environments.
Symantec Endpoint Application Isolation enables users to download and use any application safely by ensuring every application is restricted to safe and authorised behaviour. Through enhanced visibility and intelligence, suspicious applications can be isolated to prevent any privileged operations that can harm the endpoint.  Application isolation will also shield known good applications from tampering to stop attackers from exploiting potential vulnerabilities. Symantec Endpoint Cloud Connect Defense delivers dynamic protection by assuring network integrity through a policy-based smart VPN to defend against risky Wi-Fi and carrier networks. This technology provides an additional layer of protection for Windows 10 devices.
Symantec Endpoint Threat Defense for Active Directory helps ensure that malicious actors on domain-connected endpoints cannot exploit Active Directory to gain access to critical assets. Threat Defense for AD restricts post-exploit incursions by preventing credential theft and lateral movement with a unique combination of AI, obfuscation and advanced forensics methodologies to contain these attacks automatically, in real-time. This new product follows the Javelin Networks acquisition , and is another example of Symantec’s ability to quickly incorporate acquired technologies into its comprehensive portfolio.
These advanced endpoint protection and hardening capabilities will further extend Symantec’s endpoint security leadership, which has been recognised by industry analysts.
“Stopping today’s most sophisticated threats requires integrated layers of security which make it difficult for attackers to operate,” said Art Gilliland, EVP and GM Enterprise Products, Symantec. “By incorporating advanced protection and hardening innovations into our endpoint portfolio, we help minimise the attack surface and make it more challenging to penetrate and move laterally across networks, an important part of an Integrated Cyber Defense strategy.”
“At Telit we are always on the lookout for new, exciting and effective solutions. This is why we were highly interested in Symantec Endpoint Threat Defense for Active Directory. After several short days of a proof of concept we saw the value of the solution which made the decision very easy,” said Mor Asher, Global IT &amp; Information Security Manger, Telit. “We quickly covered the company endpoints with a unique and effective security layer. At almost zero impact in performance and productivity, we gain an important capability of addressing advanced attacks with much better tools in our arsenal and reduce dramatically man hours required to respond to incidents.”
Availability These innovations are immediately available for purchase as add-ons to Symantec Endpoint Protection or as part of new suites designed for easy consumption.

2005,"Finch review could determine the Fate of the Carmichael mine","THE FATE of Adani's Carmichael mine could rest in the hands of a self-proclaimed anti-coal activist and ecology professor from the University of Melbourne.

Central Queensland Senator, Matt Canavan has hit back at the Queensland Government following the controversial appointment of an independent panel to review Adani's Black-Throated Finch Management Plan.

The threatened black-throated finch (pictured below) could prove to be the undoing of Adani's Carmichael project following a State Government decision to outsource the review of the mine's management plan to a third party, in a move Adani said ""has shifted the goal-post”.

Early reports said the Threatened Species Recovery Hub (TSRH) had been selected by the State Government to review one of Adani's environmental management plans, which could decide the fate of the Carmichael mine.

A statement from the Department of Environment and Science confirmed the department had appointed Professor Brendan Wintle, of TSRH, to lead an independent expert panel and that Professor Wintle was putting together a panel of up to six leading scientific experts to conduct the review.

""DES took no part in selecting the membership of the panel, and did not contract the Threatened Species Recovery Hub to conduct the review,” the statement said.

Despite the confusion, questions still loom as to whether Professor Wintle, an open anti-coal activist, would be able to carry out the review with impartiality.

""This is just another step down the path of what seems to be a process where green activists have hijacked the Queensland Labor Government,” Senator Canavan said.

""I don't think too many Queenslanders realised when they were electing Annastasia Palaszczuk, they were actually putting the likes of Bob Brown and his ilk in charge.

""That is what seems to have happened here.

UNDER FIRE: Ecology Professor Brendan Wintle has the fate of the Carmichael mine in his hands.

Senator Canavan accused the State Government of dragging their feet on a decision regarding the Carmichael mine, and has challenged Labor leader Bill Shorten to take a stance.

""This is an abuse of process - this is meant to be an independent process which assesses the environmental impact of major projects without interference from political organisations with an agenda,” he said.

""The State Government has just gone and given this question off to a group of people who are opposed to the coal industry and jobs.

""Is Bill Shorten going to stand behind his jobs slogan on his bus and stand up for jobs here in CQ or will he be on the side of green activists that have taken control of the Queensland Government?

Version seven of the Black-Throated Finch Management Plan was submitted in 2018 and approved by the Federal Environment Department in December 2018.

An Adani spokesperson, under the assumption that TSRH would be conducting the review, has accused the State Government of secrecy and vagueness following the decision to put an independent panel in charge of the review.

""The Department has not provided any explanation to Adani as to why the review is required, or the final timeframes attached to its completion.”

Adani has previously questioned the integrity of TSRH members and their ability to conduct a fair review following a history of conflict between some members and the company.

""We are extremely concerned that members of the Threatened Species Recovery Hub have repeatedly spoken publicly that they disagree with coal mining, offset management strategies and on occasion, directly criticised the Carmichael Project,” the spokesperson said.

""We hold very serious concerns as to how the Threatened Species Recovery Hub could provide independent advice on the Black-Throated Finch Management Plan, when they are outspokenly biased on matters directly related to our project and coal generally.”

The expert review is expected to be completed in February and the findings will aid a decision regarding the acceptance of the BTFMP.

1850,"Barnwell grades the Joe Flacco trade: How did the Broncos get here? - ESPN","The most successful QB in Ravens history delivered one final clutch play -- allowing them to hand the ball off to his successor without controversy.

All of that brings us to the next lessons. In the NFL, shorter quarterbacks like Keenum have to constantly prove they can play. Tall quarterbacks get chance after chance to prove they can't play. And more important, when NFL coaches and executives are on the ropes, they're going to turn to what they know or what has worked in the past.

Come on down, Joe Flacco! The Broncos traded a midround pick to the Ravens for their deposed 6-foot-6 starter, who lost his job to Lamar Jackson and immediately saw the Ravens make a run to the postseason. ESPN's Adam Schefter noted that Flacco got enthusiastic recommendations from new Broncos coach Vic Fangio and former team executive Kubiak, each of whom was in Baltimore with Flacco earlier in his career.

Flacco has posted exactly one above-average season by passer rating or net yards per attempt since his incredible run to the Super Bowl in 2012. His Total QBR over that six-year stretch is 53.8; among the 20 passers with 2,000 or more pass attempts over that time frame, the only quarterbacks Flacco beats out are Eli Manning , Ryan Tannehill , Derek Carr and Blake Bortles . (Keenum's QBR over that time on 1,844 attempts is 51.5.)

Flacco has 5,670 career pass attempts with an ANY/A+ of 94 . He has been a slightly below-average quarterback over the course of his 11-year run. Having turned 34 in January, it's hard to believe he is suddenly going to get better over a multiyear run, especially given the lack of talent the Broncos have on offense.

Joe Flacco has a 10-5 career record in the playoffs, including a Super Bowl XLVII win. 

It will now become more difficult for the Broncos to improve that talent. In addition to sending a midround pick to the Ravens for Flacco -- and Denver does have two fourth-round picks in this draft -- the Broncos are inheriting the three years and $63 million remaining on Flacco's onerous contract with the Ravens. That contract is unguaranteed, so the Broncos could get out of Flacco's contract after one season if things go wrong.

In 2019, though, the Broncos will add $18.5 million to their cap, which leaves them with $18.3 million in space per Spotrac. Denver can create $10.3 million in room by releasing the injured Sanders, but it probably needs to add at least one veteran wideout, if not a tight end to go with him. The Broncos need to find a way to bring back Paradis, their star center, given that they're already weak up front.","__label__Neutral"

1461,"Does Reading Fiction Really Improve Your Social Ability?","Does Reading Fiction Really Improve Your Social Ability?

A meta-analysis looks at the relationship between reading and social ability.

As the founding director of the program in the Human Dimensions of Organizations at the University of Texas, I and my colleagues use the humanities and the social and behavioral sciences to teach people in workplaces about people.

Within the humanities, literature plays a significant role in what we teach. Reading literature has many potential benefits including being able to experience things within a work of fiction that you might not have a chance to experience in your life. In addition, by seeing the world through the eyes of other people, literature can give you a window into other people’s thoughts or feelings.

Does that experience create increased empathy and ability to understand others?

Psychologists have begun to explore this question by asking whether reading fiction improves people’s sensitivity to other people’s beliefs or emotions compared to either not reading or to reading nonfiction. A paper by David Dodell-Feder and Diana Tamir in the November 2018 issue of the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General looked across 14 studies using a technique called meta-analysis to determine whether there is reason to think that reading fiction improves social abilities.

These studies generally had some groups read fiction passages. Most studies had a control group in which people read nonfiction. A few of them had a control group in which the people did not read anything. A few studies compared reading fiction to both a nonfiction and a no-reading control.

Several different measures of social ability were used. Studies looked at people’s ability to read other people’s emotions, to judge their beliefs and false beliefs, to take other people’s perspectives, and to guess the emotions people would experience in different situations. Some of the measures were self-report measures (how often do you…), while others reflected performance in a task.

The authors looked at these studies but also tried to make guesses about how many unpublished studies there are likely to be in which researchers tried to get an effect of reading and failed and thus chose not to submit their paper. When researchers choose not to submit papers that have no effect of a variable, that is called the “file drawer problem.”

Overall, the authors conclude that reading fiction does indeed influence social ability. The effect is small but reliable. In addition, measures of actual performance lead to bigger effects than self-report measures.

If the effects are small, are they really worth paying attention to? The authors suggest (and I agree) that they are worth paying attention to for a few reasons:

First, if there really is a reliable influence of reading fiction on social ability, then this opens up a productive area for further research. It is hard to recommend to researchers that they explore a phenomenon if the studies are unlikely to work.

Second, most of these studies ask participants to read for a short period of time and then demonstrate an influence soon after. Over time, though, people who read a lot of fiction are likely to develop habits to pay attention to the kinds of information that fiction leads them to consider. So, the effects of reading over the long term are likely to be even stronger than what is observed in these studies (though that is something that future research should tackle).

For now, though, keep a good fiction book around and make reading part of your regular routine.

103,"Mandy Moore Revealed New 'This Is Us' Season 4 Details About Rebecca","This Is Us fans have three seasons of Pearson family drama ahead of them, but given that guaranteed amount of time, the show can't exactly tackle all of viewers' questions right away. The Season 3 finale teased where each family member ends up in about 15 to 20 years, but don't count on clarification about the future right away. Mandy Moore revealed new This Is Us Season 4 details about Rebecca , and it sounds like Moore isn't getting into that elderly makeup any time soon.
The final moments of the This Is Us Season 3 finale tied up some loose ends that sparked fans' curiosity throughout the season. A flash forward confirmed that Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson) and Randall (Sterling K. Brown) were still married, but it emphasized the ambiguity of Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Toby's (Chris Sullivan) relationship. As the family gathered at Kevin's (Justin Hartley) lavish home, Toby mentioned their son Jack had told him ""they're"" on their way, raising concerns about whether he and Kate were divorced or if Kate was even still alive. Toby also decided to join the family at the last minute, hinting that he doesn't feel totally comfortable around the Pearsons anymore.
Kevin also had a young son after breaking up with Zoe (Melanie Liburd) in the present day, but the biggest bombshell was an ailing Rebecca (Moore) and the once estranged Uncle Nicky (Griffin Dunne) watching over her. At this point in time, Rebecca slowly dying is definitely a logical explanation, but Moore has spilled that viewers may have to wait before receiving specific answers about the Pearson matriarch's condition.
""The end of that episode left us with so many questions,"" the actor recently told TVLine . ""I know that we're not going to dip into that world with my character too much, because you sort of need to let it marinate a little bit and you want to use it with great impact.""
Moore also revealed that Season 4 will delve more into Jack and Rebecca's early years, specifically after they return to Pittsburgh from their spontaneous cross-country road trip. ""This season ... we're gonna kind of follow them back from that road trip in California to back to Pittsburgh and really see how they become a couple,"" she said. ""I'm curious to see, like ... how does he really open himself up, how do they get engaged? There's so much of that really defining time in their relationship that I'm curious to explore.""
With three confirmed seasons in store, This Is Us has to save some twists for later years, so maybe Rebecca's story will have to wait until Season 5 or 6. Although the finale flash forward has established paths for Season 4 to begin, it's not the destination that counts. This Is Us viewers are here for the journey, and if the first three seasons are anything to go by, it'll be a tear-soaked adventure. ""The finale sets us up for a fourth season that kind of acts as a hinge or a midpoint for the rest of the series,” creator Dan Fogelman told PEOPLE . “There’s a lot coming.”
Season 4 of This Is Us premieres on NBC this fall.","__label__Neutral"

707,"Former Australian judges call for national anti-corruption body","Dozens of former Australian judges published an open letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison (above) on Sunday calling for a national anti-corruption body to restore public trust in the country's democratic process.

The letter, written by 34 former judges including Gerard Brennan, the former chief justice of the High Court of Australia, the country's peak court, said there is public suspicion that corruption permeates many government actions.

""Secrecy is at the core of corrupt conduct,"" they said in the letter, published in the Sunday Age newspaper.

""Existing federal integrity agencies lack the necessary jurisdiction, powers and know-how to investigate properly the impartiality and bona-fides of decisions made by, and conduct of, the federal government and public sector.""

Public concerns over possible corruption in government decision-making have heightened in recent years.

Transparency International Australia, an anti-corruption organisation, conducted a survey in June that found 85 percent of people believe at least some members of the national parliament are corrupt, and two-thirds of Australians support the creation of a national anti-corruption body.

A government minister in the state of New South Wales was jailed last year for wilful misconduct in public office, after gifting a mining licence without a competitive tender.

Concerns have also been raised over senior public servants winning lucrative consultancies or board positions from firms which then win contracts from their previous departments, said AJ Brown, professor of public policy at Griffith University and board member of Transparency International.

The judges' letter was co-ordinated by progressive think tank The Australia Institute, which worked with legal experts to design an anti-corruption body.

Australia Institute researcher Hannah Aulby said their goal was to support transparency in the political process. ""There's not enough accountability,"" she told Reuters by telephone.

Independent MP Cathy McGowan plans to table a bill to establish a national anti-corruption body in federal parliament when it resumes on Monday. The Labor opposition supports a national anti-corruption body but the move is opposed by the ruling conservative minority government.

Attorney-general Christian Porter told Reuters the model would give extraordinary powers against public servants with a definition of ""corruption"" that was too broad.

""Those powers could be used without proper checks and balances,"" he said in an emailed statement.","__label__Neutral"

Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, seen throwing a pass in the Pro Bowl on Jan. 27 in Orlando, Florida, has agreed to a new contract through 2023. | AP

RENTON, WASHINGTON - Russell Wilson is sticking around with the Seattle Seahawks as the highest paid player in the NFL.

Wilson posted a video on social media early Tuesday saying, “Seattle, we got a deal,” shortly after agreeing to a $140 million, four-year extension with the Seahawks, his agent Mark Rodgers told The Associated Press. Wilson’s new deal runs through the 2023 season and includes a $65 million signing bonus, a no-trade clause and $107 million in guaranteed money.

Wilson’s per year average of $35 million tops Aaron Rodgers’ average annual salary of $33.5 million as part of the $134 million extension he signed last year with the Green Bay Packers.

Wilson’s current $87.6 million, four-year deal was signed at the beginning of training camp in 2015 and was set to expire after next season.

“Russell’s goal and his hope was that he would continue his career with the Seahawks and continue to bring championships to this town,” Rodgers said. “He believes there is still unfinished business and he is looking forward to pursuing that without having to worry about contracts and his future.”

The 30-year-old Wilson had set a midnight deadline for a new deal with Seattle. He wanted certainty about his contract before the start of the team’s offseason workout program, which began on Monday. Wilson showed up for the first day and by the end of the night was posting a video with wife Ciara announcing the agreement.

The deal ends the debate about Wilson’s future with the Seahawks, although there seemed to be little doubt he would remain in Seattle for a while. The team held leverage knowing it likely had at least three more seasons with Wilson under center. Even if he played out 2019 under his current deal, Seattle could have used the franchise tag if needed to keep him under contract through 2020 and 2021 at a reasonable price by quarterback standards.

But the extension allows Seattle to budget for the future knowing how to work with Wilson’s hefty paycheck in the years ahead and build a contender around the former third-round pick that has developed into a franchise QB.

Wilson’s new deal was going to have to top the extension signed by Rodgers before the start of last season. Wilson was the second-highest paid player in football behind Rodgers when his deal was signed in 2015, but had fallen to the 12th highest-paid QB in the league, according to Overthecap.com .

The five-time Pro Bowl selection is coming off arguably his best season as Seattle went a surprising 10-6 and earned an NFC wild card berth before losing to Dallas in the opening round of the playoffs. It was supposed to be a rebuilding year, but the Seahawks were ahead of schedule thanks to their return to a run-first offense and Wilson’s exceptional performance when tasked to throw.

The 180-cm Wilson threw for a career-high 35 touchdowns and matched his career low with seven interceptions. He attempted only 427 passes — his lowest total since his second season when Seattle won the Super Bowl — but his efficiency was a career best with a 110.9 passer rating. He also ran only 67 times, a career low, as the improved run game and offensive line play allowed Wilson to stay in the pocket more and scramble for his life less.

It was a stark change from the 2017 season when Seattle missed the playoffs for the first time under Wilson. He led the league in touchdown passes, but also was Seattle’s leading rusher due to a non-existent run game.

The idea of Wilson ever leaving Seattle has always seemed a stretch. Teams simply don’t give up on quarterbacks with the kind of success he’s had. Wilson has led the Seahawks to the playoffs in six of his seven seasons, the only miss coming in 2017 when Seattle finished 9-7. He won a Super Bowl in his second season and got back to the championship game a year later before making the one major mistake of his career that will linger until he wins another title, throwing a goal line interception in the final minute when the Seahawks had a chance to take the lead on New England.

Wilson has shelved the stigma of short quarterbacks being unable to play in the NFL. He’s also been extremely durable, never missing a game while playing through significant knee, ankle and shoulder injuries.","__label__Neutral"

The opinions, facts and any media content in them are presented solely by the authors, and neither The Times of Israel nor its partners assume any responsibility for them. Please contact us in case of abuse. In case of abuse,

The Women’s Marches in 2017 and 2018 were dramatic and proud expressions of a commitment to equality and justice for women, people of color, LGBTQ Americans, and all who have been systemically impacted by the hateful rhetoric that has been emboldened over the last 3 years. So many people participated in these marches across the country and in Washington, DC as part of a national movement of resistance and defiance, and many will do so again this weekend.

In the shadow of these historic events, there has been a deeply hurtful and resurgent tremor beneath the surface, a reminder that anti-Semitism remains the world’s oldest hatred, with insensitivities, tropes, and a seemingly flagrant embrace of anti-Semitic leaders from those whom we count on as allies and friends.

There is not enough space here to rehash the back and forth between Women’s March leaders and the Jewish women who have been at the forefront of the discord of the last two years – all of whom I believe are determined to find a way to a promised land of equality and justice for all. Ultimately, divisions between Jews and People of Color only serve to further the aims of those white supremacists and nationalists, who have always pitted us together, and see us as other.

In recent weeks, I have been heartened that several of my colleagues and friends – feminists, rabbis, teachers, activists all – have been meeting with leaders of the National Women’s March to better understand one another, to listen, to share, and ultimately to come closer to the kind of empathic solidarity that can work for everyone. It isn’t perfect, and there has been a lot of hurt to go around. It has, in a sense, already been a very long and hard road since the pink knitted hats flooded the streets of America in 2017, and we are clearly still on the edge of the narrowness of America in 2019.

I was thinking about this when I opened the text of Parashat Beshallah.  This portion tells of the dramatic exodus from Egypt following the plagues, and the climactic parting and crossing of the Sea of Reeds by the Israelites, their celebration upon reaching the other side, and their initial challenges of being free people.

The text begins with the verse, “When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although that was the nearer (ki karov hu)…” (Exodus 13:17)  Upon leaving Egypt, there were two possible routes to the Promised Land: through the Land of the Philistines, a nearer and perhaps easier route; and through the wilderness, the harder and farther route.   It is not surprising that the text wants us to understand that the way to the Promised Land was not going to be a straight shot, without challenges or disappointments.   The text is reminding us that the precious milestones and achievements we have reached on a winding path in our personal and political lives, are often the hardest won and can be the most rewarding.

Jews, Muslims, People of Color, women, LGBTQ people, and immigrants have all been through a communal “Egypt,” and each of us individually has likely been through our own Egypt, and if we haven’t yet, we know there will be inevitably difficult  experiences on our way into the future.  If everything we have came easily, would we appreciate its value? Of course, we would all like to avoid unnecessary hardship and oppression, but we also know that in order for racial, economic, and gender justice to be achieved in America, we in the Jewish community must continue to stand up against the threats to democracy and make that journey to the promised land, however long it is.

The Israelites faced an uncertain future when they left Egypt, but knew there was no turning back.  Redemption did give way to revelation, as Sinai was on the harder path taken by the newly freed, mixed multitude on the way to becoming a people.  Their diversity did give way to unity, and they, and we, are instructed to listen to, and for, the Oneness that links all that is.

Whether or not you participate in a local march or in the National Women’s March this coming weekend, the commitment to justice and liberation for all people requires all of us to stay in the fight. We all have a lot to learn about the complex intersections of anti-Semitism and racism, and remembering and then transforming the meaning of our “Egypt” and the hard road to promise, is not only crucial to our spiritual lives, it is vital to our shared humanity.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister on Sunday ruled out the extradition of suspects in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after Istanbul’s chief prosecutor filed warrants for the arrest of two former senior Saudi officials.
Turkish officials said last week that the prosecutor’s office had concluded there was “strong suspicion” that Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and General Ahmed al-Asiri, who served as deputy head of foreign intelligence, were among the planners of Khashoggi’s Oct. 2 killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
“We don’t extradite our citizens,” Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said when asked about the arrest warrants. He was speaking at a news conference at a Gulf Arab summit in Riyadh.
Last month, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned 17 Saudis, including Qahtani but not Asiri, for their role in Khashoggi’s murder.
The Saudi public prosecutor has said the order to repatriate Khashoggi came from Asiri and that a travel ban has been imposed on Qahtani. Jubeir declined to confirm or deny whether the men were currently detained, referring the question to the Saudi public prosecutor.

905,"New ServiceIQ Gateway Scholar Defies Gravity","Tia Warwick from Oxford in Canterbury is living proof that a ServiceIQ Gateway programme gives secondary students the grounding they need to lift-off into a career they’re passionate about.

Tia Warwick, ServiceIQ Aviation Gateway graduate and Scholarship winner gets the feel of a Supermarine Spitfire replica.

At only 16 years-old, Tia is earning admiration and congratulations for completing the ServiceIQ Aviation Gateway programme and being awarded the coveted ServiceIQ Flying NZ Flight Training Scholarship 2019.

Tia’s first flight with Air Cadets – 88 Squadron Rangiora was life changing.

“I knew right then and there that flying was my passion and my future career. This has been crystalised by my aviation studies with the ServiceIQ Gateway programme and my weekly evening classes with our instructor Des Lines. I also have a really helpful mentor in Air New Zealand’s Janelle Rouse,” says Tia.

Tia’s parents have been equally supportive and encouraged her to overcome her fear of heights to take that first flight.

Since then, she’s clocked-up 21 hours of flight training.

But learning to fly is an expensive pursuit and Tia is funding her time in the sky by doing chores around the house and working at a local book shop.

The ServiceIQ Flying NZ Flight Training Scholarship 2019 gives her $2,000 of flight training delivered by the Canterbury Aero Club. The funds are going to be very handy especially as Tia is aiming to achieve her private pilot’s licence next year.

Further on her horizon is a Bachelor of Aviation at Massey University and afterwards the sky is the limit.

“I would like to work for the Flying Doctors in Australia. I love helping people and this would combine my passion for flying and giving back to others. I would also like to apply for a job with a commercial airline, hopefully Air New Zealand.”

Tia is realistic and knows objectives do change in life, but she’s absolutely clear that flying will always be part of her future.

“Flying defies gravity, we were not born or created to fly, yet our ancestors found a way to achieve the seemingly impossible. This is what I think about when I fly. When I’m in the cockpit it’s just me, the views and the plane. For me, being in a plane is my passion, it represents freedom, history and opportunity.”

ServiceIQ’s Aviation Gateway programme is extremely popular with students keen to discover exciting roles and the real chance to kick-start a career in the fast-moving industry.

As Industry Training Organisation for the aviation industry, ServiceIQ sets the standards and develops on-job qualification training programmes and apprenticeships for a huge range of roles for men and women - from aircraft engineers, pilots, air traffic controllers, flight attendants, and check-in agents to aircraft loaders, aircraft cleaners, aeronautical store keepers, aircraft maintenance engineers, airport operations staff and many more.

2160,"20 Tweets About Varys' Death On 'Game Of Thrones' That Are Honestly Too Much To Handle","Welp, it finally happened: The Spider met his shocking demise on Game of Thrones during Season 8, Episode 5, when Daenerys Targaryen sentenced him to death by dragonfire for committing treason. Fans weren't exactly shocked given the rapid-fire deaths of major characters this season, but these tweets about Varys’s death reveal that even though it might have been his time to go, it’s also, well, kind of a bummer. After all, Varys was one of the most central figures in the eight-season saga, even if his role (and screen time) had become diminished in recent episodes.

In Episode 4, Varys did something totally uncharacteristic for this usually savvy spy: He tipped his hand in a conversation with Tyrion about his decision to change alliances from Daenerys Targaryen towards throwing his support behind Jon Snow as ruler of the seven kingdoms. While Varys has never made his loyalty to the realm above all else a secret, it finally caught up with him, and he got burned in the end. (Sorry, I couldn't resist — humor is my way of dealing with tragedy.)

It was pretty heartbreaking to see someone who had proven himself to be one of the greatest all-time players of the game of thrones go down so swiftly, but it's a stark reminder of just how high the stakes have become at this late stage. The circumstances leading to Varys' demise were also especially hard to witness since Tyrion played a prominent role in it. The two have a history, not to mention the fact that Varys had saved his life in the past. Bittersweet doesn't even begin to cover it. Plus, that final look the longtime friends shared, not to mention Tyrion's last grasp of Varys' hand, was just absolutely heartbreaking AF.

For some folks taking to Twitter after watching the events on-screen, Daenerys' decision to put Varys to death had them feeling some type of way about the dragon queen. By that, we mean thinking that she either reacted too swiftly or too coldly. In fact, they saw it as evidence that she was edging toward full mad queen territory. Like father, like daughter, after all?

Other fans were just going through genuine mourning for another amazing character gone what seemed like far too soon. And for yet more people tweeting, it was all about the legacy of Varys' final act. After all, it sure looked like he was getting the word out about who should be the true ruler of the seven kingdoms. Judging by subsequent events in the episode, it certainly seems like a prudent move on his part. For everyone's sake, we'd better hope his messages were actually dispatched to relatively sane recipients before he got Daenerys' royal flambé treatment.

Even with so many characters meeting their end this season, judging by the audience's reaction to Varys' death, this one really did sting. RIP Master of Whispers, you will be missed — although we may not have seen the last of your influence in Westeros just yet.","__label__Neutral"

Saitama kabaddi club makes name for itself, hopes to spread sport in Japan

SAITAMA – Fascinated by the contact sport of kabaddi, a middle school and a high school in Saitama Prefecture beat a succession of collegiate teams this year to win the national student championship after learning the rules and tactics from scratch.

Seven years ago, Jiyunomori Gakuin Junior and Senior High School in Saitama Prefecture created Japan’s only kabaddi club below collegiate level. Having stood on the national podium, they are now hoping the sport will draw wider interest from people in their generation.

Kabaddi, which has its roots in India, is played between two teams of seven players on a small court without any equipment. The objective is for an offensive player known as the “raider” to tag the opposing team’s defenders in their half of the court and return safely to his own half without being tackled.

The game’s name is said to derive from a Tamil word meaning “to hold hands.” The raiders are required to repeatedly chant “kabaddi” as proof the raid occurs during a single breath.

A non-Olympic sport, kabaddi is popular in South Asia and has a large following at the Asian Games. It has struggled to gain traction in Japan, which only has about 400 registered players, according to the Japan Kabaddi Association.

At a Tokyo gymnasium in June, the Jiyunomori Gakuen men’s team challenged an older university team. During one half, the younger players surrounded the university’s raider and a Jiyunomori defender set up a tackle, allowing his six teammates to hold the opponent tight on the floor.

“Even if we have a disadvantage in terms of our physical size, we don’t lose in terms of technique and teamwork,” said 18-year-old captain Issei Ogawa, a third-year student at Jiyunomori.

Katsumi Abe, at 15 the youngest player eligible to play on the men’s national team, hopes many students will follow in the footsteps of the pioneering athletes.

“I want there to be more players in my age group who share interest in the sport,” Abe said. “Personally, I want to develop techniques and enough mental strength that will enable me to beat adult players.”

The club was created in June 2011 after a second-year high school student asked his peers to play the sport in a school hallway after watching it on television. After the students discovered there was no kabaddi club below the collegiate level, they decided to create their own.

“Nobody knew about the sport since it’s not at all popular,” said Mizuki Nakashima, 23, who was one of the founding members of the club. “We were really excited that it would be the first in Japan, and we just went on to make the club.”

The members learned the rules from the Japan Kabaddi Association and trained with university teams. They struggled against university and adult teams but managed to win their first official game in February 2013.

Since then, the Jiyunomori Gakuin team has developed its strength and technique with support from alumni and become Japan’s top team this February at a tournament for university teams and below.

“They were able to win because the students made efforts on their own, and this bore fruit as adults who were moved by their passion supported them along the way,” said Kaho Suga, a Jiyunomori teacher who oversees the team.

The Japan Kabaddi Association has been aiming to attract more people to the sport by holding demonstrations around the country.

“I want to establish more opportunities for the younger generation to experience kabaddi,” said Yoji Kawai, 43, an association official.

“We are willing to send members of the association who can teach the sport if a high school is interested. I hope to hear from them.”","__label__Neutral"
1334,"Pete Alonso already Mets’ difference maker thanks to Van Wagenen","ATLANTA — Imagine if the Mets reported to SunTrust Park Friday afternoon and welcomed Pete Alonso, just recalled from Triple-A Syracuse, while wishing him good luck in his major league debut.
Would you take that scenario in return for Alonso not reaching free agency until after the 2025 season?
As if to save his best for last in this bonus period, to reward the Mets one last time for doing the right thing, the rookie slugger made his loudest statement yet here on Thursday night. Alonso’s team-leading sixth homer ensured that the Mets would prevail, 6-3, in their first game of the season against the Braves and placed his team (8-4) alone atop the ultra-competitive National League East.
And what a homer it was. The two-run, seventh-inning laser off Braves reliever Jonny Venters traveled low and carried until it splashed into the pond well behind the center-field wall. Statcast measured it at a towering 454 feet, and more impressive, the exit velocity of 118.3 miles per hour ranked as the ninth-hardest round-tripper of the Statcast era, as noted by SNY field reporter Steve Gelbs. The eight harder homers all came off the bats of two players: Yankees Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton.
ATLANTA — Amed Rosario’s strong finish to last season could...
“I gotta do a couple more push-ups,” Alonso quipped, before adding, “That’s really cool. To be in the same category as those two guys, it means a lot.”
Laughter pervaded the Mets’ clubhouse, as they kicked off this extremely important 10-game road swing — four here versus the defending division champs, three in Philadelphia with Bryce Harper’s Phillies and three in St. Louis against the perennially contending Cardinals — with a nice victory. Amed Rosario drove home the Mets’ first four runs, cranking a three-run homer in the second and adding an RBI single in the sixth, and Steven Matz threw six strong innings for his first win of the season, allowing four hits and a walk while striking out eight.
And with the Mets’ bullpen continuing its heart-rate-increasing ways, allowing a total of seven base runners (if just one run) over three innings, Alonso’s blast provided some much-appreciated insurance in an enjoyably explosive package.
“Most of the time our jaws are dropped and we’re going, Wow,’ ” Mickey Callaway said of his rookie’s routine power displays, each of Alonso’s homers a notable work of art. “You don’t see stuff like that. It’s a line drive and it goes in the fountain where you see a splash. That’s insane. I don’t know if it went through the wall and went into the fountain or it just snuck over and hit the water.
“But he does something special every night, and I think we talked about it in spring training. When he’s at the plate, you feel like something’s going to happen. And something usually does.”
“When you kind of hit a ball like that, you don’t even feel it,” Alonso said. “You get this weird sensation. I can’t even explain it. You don’t feel the ball off your bat. You just hear the sound and it just goes.”
It was, Alonso said, “definitely the hardest ball I’ve hit in my life,” and it further validated the decision pushed by rookie general manager Brodie Van Wagenen — who watched the game with his adviser Jessica Mendoza of ESPN — and permitted by ownership. Because Alonso started the season with the big-league club, he stands on a track to be a free agent after 2024. And, in what seems like a fair trade-off, the 2019 Mets stand in a far better position thanks to the extra 15 days of Alonso’s presence.
“I’m really grateful,” Alonso said. “I’m so happy to be here. I’ve just been so appreciative of everything. Everyone’s been fantastic. We’ve got great guys in the locker room. In this atmosphere, every single night’s just a blessing. I’m just trying to make the most of this opportunity.”
If he makes any more of the opportunity, the Braves might have to call in a maintenance team.","__label__Positive"
2672,"Scientists study how to predict marine heatwaves","NIWA-led research finding a link between their formation and the length of time sea temperatures are warmer than normal.
For the past two summers, the Tasman Sea has experienced a marine heatwave, where periods of extremely warm sea surface temperatures persisted for a prolonged period of time and extended thousands of kilometres.
They are potentially devastating for marine ecosystems but are expected to become more frequent under a range of climate change scenarios. Recent studies have shown they also have a strong influence on climate, temperature and rainfall patterns.
NIWA scientist Dr Erik Behrens is the lead author of a new research paper showing that ocean currents in the Tasman Sea are controlling the oceanic heat content and marine heat waves in the Tasman Sea. The paper has just been published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science, which has dedicated the entire issue to marine heatwave findings.
Dr Behrens says marine heatwaves are difficult to predict because there are numerous factors influencing how and when they occur.
However, using scientific models in combination with observations from satellites and autonomous ocean drifters, he was able to show a relationship between changes in heat content in the Tasman Sea and the size and intensity of marine heatwaves over years and decades.
“Measuring ocean heat content is like measuring fever but in the ocean and tells you a lot about its wellbeing. If the ocean is already warm, the likelihood for marine heatwaves is enhanced because less surface heating is required to drive temperature extremes.”
Dr Behrens’ research showed heat fluctuations in the Tasman Sea are dominated by more warm water being transported from the subtropics by the East Australian Current and Tasman Front with the heat content acting as a preconditioner for the development of marine heatwaves.
“The flow of warm water from the subtropics varies a lot, which results in warmer and colder years. But on average the Tasman Sea is a region of oceanic heat convergence, meaning that average surface heat fluxes are directed toward the atmosphere, balancing the oceanic heat convergence. On average around 67% of the ocean heat transported from the subtropics into the Tasman Sea warms the atmosphere” Dr Behrens said.
There are at least two different mechanisms affecting the occurrence of marine heatwaves in the Tasman Sea: heat content which is persistent and enables long-term predictability, and winds and surface heating which is harder to predict, since they vary on shorter time scales.
“Periods with enhanced heat content or when ocean heat content increases rapidly, increase the likelihood of marine heatwaves developing. However, if winds are strong during the same time then the marine heat waves are milder.”
Marine heatwave conditions continued in the Tasman Sea throughout April. NIWA forecasters predict these warmer than average seas may lead to a reduction in the intensity and duration of cold spells over winter.

Along the way, a few cyclones have also been thrown our way and summer bushfires are always expected.
But, like many people, this week has been beyond anything I've seen in Rockhampton.
There's been a building sense of foreboding as the temperatures have risen, building to an almost apocalyptic sense of dread on Wednesday.
By the time I came back from my lunch break, we were facing a disaster of potentially catastrophic proportions.
I'm sure I echo the sentiments of everyone when I say how grateful I am for everyone in the emergency services who faces these dangers head on for us and may be the only reason we avoided such a tragic outcome.
It was a surreal experience to be reporting on fires, the scale of which I had before only ever witnessed in news coverage of far away places.
However, the most shocking scenes we saw as we flew over the fire zones were those homes which came so close to the flames.

15,"Harvard Lampoon apologizes for ‘deeply offensive’ Anne Frank bikini image","The Harvard Lampoon has apologized for printing a sexualized image of Anne Frank in its latest issue, insisting that it denounces “all forms” of anti-Semitism.
The image was published over the weekend, and the student-run magazine only apologized after an uproar from those who said there was nothing funny about trivializing the Holocaust.
“Gone Before Her Time: Virtual Aging Technology Shows Us What Anne Frank Would Have Looked Life if She Hadn’t Died,” read the text above the badly Photoshopped image. “Add this to your list of reasons the Holocaust sucked.”
The magazine’s co-presidents and issue editor said in a statement that they “realize the extent of offense” the image had inflicted and took responsibility for its publication.
“We as individuals and we as an organization would like to apologize for our negligence in allowing this piece to be created for and printed in our latest issue,” the statement reads . “We are sorry for any harm we have caused. Furthermore, we want to both affirm and emphasize that the Lampoon condemns any and all forms of anti-Semitism.”
Founded in 1876, the magazine  – whose illustrious alumnus includes writers John Updike and George Plimpton, as well as late night host Conan O’Brien — will now approach its craft with “greater care” moving forward, according to the statement.
“We realize that our publishing process lacks sufficient editorial oversight, so we are going to restructure our review process for issues to prevent the publication of content like this,” the statement continued. “These steps will be published on our website in the summer. However, they will constitute part of an ongoing process of change.”
A message seeking comment from university officials was not immediately returned early Wednesday.
More than 280 Harvard students have signed a petition denouncing the image, the student-run Harvard Crimson reports . Rabbi Jonah Steinberg, executive director of Harvard Hillel, also emailed the magazine’s editors and compared the photo to the “obscenity of the Nazis” and said sexualized Frank, the German-born Jewish girl who penned a diary of her experience during the Holocaust before dying in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at 15.
“Your depiction of Anne Frank’s face grafted to pinup imagery goes far beyond the distastefulness and provocativeness you obviously intend,” Steinberg wrote. “It is the sexual violation of a child – one who, in life, was subjected to the most hideous of crimes.”
A Lampoon contributor whose initials can be found on the image, Cristobal de Losada Lopez de Romana, did not return a request for comment, the Crimson reports.
The head of the Anti-Defamation League’s New England office, meanwhile, said the likeness simply went too far.
“They crossed the line from humor into anti-Semitism,” Robert Trestan told the Boston Globe . “They’re using humor as an excuse to trivialize the Holocaust, and it’s deeply offensive.”","__label__Negative"
1622,"Still Want To Boycott Israel? Israeli Scientists Find Cure For Cancer, Report Says - The Daily Wire","Still Want To Boycott Israel? Israeli Scientists Find Cure For Cancer, Report Says

For all the Israel-haters out there, they’d better hope that that Israelis are forgiving if they are stricken with cancer, because if a new report out of Israel turns out to be true, scientists in the Jewish state have discovered a cure. And not just a cure for certain forms of cancer, but a complete cure for the deadly disease.

According to Dan Aridor, chairman of the board of Accelerated Evolution Biotechnologies Ltd. (AEBi) and CEO Dr. Ilan Morad, their treatment will not need time for the body to acculturate to it before it works. Aridor stated, “We believe we will offer in a year’s time a complete cure for cancer. … Our cancer cure will be effective from day one ... and will have no or minimal side-effects at a much lower cost than most other treatments on the market. Our solution will be both generic and personal.”

As the Jerusalem Post reports, “An estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide each year, according to reports by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Further, every sixth death in the world is due to cancer, making it the second leading cause of death (second only to cardiovascular disease).”

The treatment is called MuTaTo (multi-target toxin), and works much like antibiotics do in targeting bacteria. MuTaTo is based on SoAP technology, which works by finding, binding and removing bacteria by utilizing bacteriophage-derived proteins. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria.

MuTaTo inserts DNA coding for a protein into a bacteriophage. Once inside, the protein shows up on the phage’s surface, making it apparent to researchers who can use the phages to find interactions with other proteins, DNA sequences and small molecules. Unlike 2018 Nobel Prize-winning scientists George Smith and Gregory Winter, who used phage display to evolve new proteins or antibodies, the Israelis are producing peptides, which Morad says are better equipped for the job because they are smaller, less expensive and less difficult to manage.

Morad said the company’s initial efforts involved attempting to find “individual novel peptides for specific cancers.” But then he and colleague Dr. Hanan Itzhaki decided to go for broke. He explained that most anti-cancer drugs attack a specific target on or in the cancer cell, but they often trigger a mutation that makes the drug ineffective. But MuTato, as the Jerusalem Post notes, uses “a combination of several cancer-targeting peptides for each cancer cell at the same time, combined with a strong peptide toxin that would kill cancer cells specifically.”

Morad said that the company’s technique “made sure that the treatment will not be affected by mutations; cancer cells can mutate in such a way that targeted receptors are dropped by the cancer … The probability of having multiple mutations that would modify all targeted receptors simultaneously decreases dramatically with the number of targets used. Instead of attacking receptors one at a time, we attack receptors three at a time – not even cancer can mutate three receptors at the same time.”

Morad said MuTato, because it attacks multiple targets, destroys the proteins targeted on the cancer cell. Morad also said because the peptide parts of MuTaTo are tiny and flexible, they can penetrate areas other drugs fail to reach. He stated, “This should make the whole molecule non-immunogenic in most cases and would enable repeated administration of the drug.”

Morad said the treatment could reduce side effects , which often arise because cancer treatments either connect with the wrong or additional targets, or the right targets on healthy cells. Aridor concluded, “Our results are consistent and repeatable.”","__label__Neutral"

2076,"Windows 10 1903: Dates in conversational format in Explorer - Ghacks Technology News","by Martin Brinkmann on December 04, 2018 in Windows - 5 comments

The snail-paced rollout of Windows 10 version 1809 is still ongoing as development of Windows 10 version 1903 continues to push new features that might be supported in the next feature update for Windows 10.

Microsoft has not changed the schedule yet; Windows 10 version 1903 is expected in late March or early April 2019.

Users who run Insider versions of Windows 10 can test some of the functionality already. Microsoft tests a new feature in File Explorer currently that displays the data in conversational format.

File Explorer, the default file browser of Windows 10, displays modification dates by default. The dates that it displays uses the format day-month-year-time, e.g. 04-Oct-18 09:26 AM by default (as do other date listings such as creation date).

The new conversational format for dates in File Explorer changes this to a format that removes the time parameter from the listing in most instances and changes the date as well.

File Explorer displays dates such as August 4, 2010, Yesterday at 13:26, or ""just now"" instead in listings.

The format uses rules that determine what is displayed to the user:

Current year dates omit the year.

All dates older than 2 days are displayed in the format Month Day, e.g. November 29.

Sorting works as expected; File Explorer takes the full date and time into account and sorts the file and folder listing of the active folder based on that.

It is unclear whether the new conversational format will be the default in Windows 10 version 1903. Recent builds include a setting to turn the new format on or off:

Open File Explorer on Windows 10.

Select View and click on the Options button.

Switch to the View tab in the Folder Options window that opens.

Check the option to enable the new conversational format and uncheck it to turn it off and go back to the default format used in previous versions of the Windows operating system.

The functionality is powered by a value in the Registry:

Open the Registry Editor on the system. Tap on the Windows-key to display Start, type regedit.exe, and select the result to load it.

Confirm the UAC prompt that Windows displays.

If it does not exist, right-click on Advanced and select New &gt; Dword (32-bit) Value.

Double-click on the value and set it to the value 1 to use the new conversational format or to 0 to use the old date display format.

We have created a Registry script that you may run to enable or disable the new format for dates. Download the zip archive with the two Registry scripts with a click on the following link: w10-conversational-format-file-explorer.zip

Now You: Do you prefer the old or the new format? (via Deskmodder )

Microsoft plans to add a new date display format to File Explorer in Windows 10 version 1903 called conversational format.","__label__Neutral"

Respondents to the central bank's quarterly survey predict consumer price inflation of 1.97 percent a year from now, up from the 1.82 percent rate expected in the March survey. Two-year expectations were for inflation of 2.01 percent versus 2.02 percent in the prior survey.
A net 64.7 percent of respondents believe current monetary conditions are easier than neutral. That is down from a net 68.3 percent in the previous quarter’s survey.  ""Easier than neutral"" indicates rates which are low enough to stoke growth.
The survey comes just ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's monetary policy statement and rate decision - the first to be made by committee - tomorrow afternoon.
Economists are on the fence as to whether the central bank might cut rates by 25 basis points to a record low 1.50 percent; markets are pricing in about a 60 percent chance.
""The decision will be a very close call, with strong arguments for both cutting and holding,"" Westpac Bank's head of NZ strategy Imre Speizer said. ""The stronger argument is for cutting: the RBNZ has not met its inflation target for seven years.""
The survey's respondents trimmed their outlook for economic growth. They now expect GDP to rise an annual rate of 2.19 percent one year ahead, down from 2.38 percent in the prior survey. Two years ahead, they see it lifting at an annual rate of 2.17 percent versus 2.36 percent in the prior survey.
The unemployment rate is seen at 4.3 percent in one year and 4.32 percent in two years. The latest Stats NZ data had unemployment at 4.2 percent in the March quarter.
One-year ahead expectations for annual growth in wages are steady around 2.89 percent, while two-year ahead expectations increased marginally from 2.86 percent to 2.93 percent in the latest survey.","__label__Neutral"

1725,"Nothing – “Heavy Water/I’d Rather Be Sleeping” (Grouper Cover)","Nothing, the Philadelphia shoegaze band made up of hardcore punk veterans, released their new album Dance On The Blacktop last year. Next month, they’re playing at our Range Life party in Austin during SXSW. (Come through!) And today, they’ve announced a new compilation called Spirit Of The Stairs – B-Sides &amp; Rarities.

1959,"Newt Gingrich: Blue wave of liberal cash from California and New York flooding Georgia governor&#x27;s...","The most interesting thing he said is that he is confident the Republicans will retain control of the House and Senate.

16 posted on 09/30/2018 6:01:03 PM PDT by SaxxonWoods (Stop The Madness. Do Not Respond To Vanity Posts.)

I read someplace local that 2 counties in NY had out-donated the entire state of ND in our senatorial election.

You can guess what party this was for.

Agreed, and Newt knows of what he speaks, I believe he’s right.

You know Newt, some of us tried to warn the GOPe/RNC not to run from Roy Moore. I wonder if any of them can figure out what that reason was today?

It’s not so much the money from the coasts. It’s the disorganized, pathetic, suicidal, environment Conservative candidates find themselves in today.

This Kavanaugh mess isn’t confined to the U. S. Senate. It spreads out across the political spectrum.

McConnell and Grassley allowed this to become a circus. No, I don’t think Kavanaugh is going to be rejected ultimately, but it’s the fog of war, and the little guys on down the line are lost in the news.

Our guys can’t get traction. Everyone is talking about FBI investigations and the like. Why another woman just came forward, and news like that sucking the life blood.

Stand up for our people. Quite allowing the other side to raise these false issues. You ran from Roy Moore and now you’re just shocked that they would try the same think on Kavanaugh that worked on him.

We tried to tell you mother F’rs what was going to happen.

You laughed. You had Republican politicians in Washington making robo calls against Moore. You guys abandoned him, and worse.

Here we are. The Kavanaugh hearings are sucking up all the oxygen in the room, and all you idiots can talk about is the Democrats this, or the Democrats that.

The Republican party is a pathetic entity.

Sadly, it’s all we’ve got too, other than Trump who can’t get them to help him either.

I’m pretty sure that the Republicans need 50 votes to confirm Kavanaugh. No 50 votes, no confirmation. On Friday, we only had 48 votes, because Murkowski and Collins insisted on a FBI Investigation. What the Republicans should have done in this scenario?","__label__Negative"
2522,"The Best Breakup Advice For Your Early 20s, According To 8 Women","Sometimes, a fun night out ends in eating Thai food in an Uber, creeping on your new crush with a friend, then delicately washing your face before blissfully falling asleep in the bed you made that morning. And sometimes, they can end with your feet getting cut up in blisters and waking up with your lashes stuck together. Romantic relationships — like fun nights out — can end nicely or painfully. Good, bad, or ugly, this best breakup advice for your early 20s may be all you need to hear to heal your heartache.
After a breakup, everything can seem hard. Whether you're knee-deep in tissues and ice cream, holding the pieces of your broken heart or getting over your ex by getting under someone new , sometimes the only thing you need after a breakup is some loving advice. Hearing from resilient women who have had their heart broken and have learned to love again can be a tender and special way to start to heal after a major breakup.
I spoke to eight women about the best breakup advice they had for dating in your early 20s, and what they said is so real.
You’re young and this is far from the end. That may seem every sadder or scarier right now, but chances are you're going to have many more breakups and many more heartaches. You've got a long way to go.
Well, I don’t really think there is a right way to do it. Of course, try and be respectful of the other person but if you have to get out of a relationship, don’t feel bad about communicating that in a way that makes it easier for you.
Breakup sex is great and isn’t weird at all. Like, you break up and there are lots of emotions. You have sex as an outlet, so it’s almost always great because you both know it is, or could be, the last time.","__label__Neutral"
477,"Study: Gender Pay Gap Results from Women Making Different Choices","Women in general value time and flexibility more than men, says study

In November, Harvard economists Valentin Bolotnyy and Natalia Emanuel published a new working paper titled “Why Do Women Earn Less Than Men? Evidence from Bus and Train Operators.”

In the study, Bolotnyy and Emanuel study unionized bus and train operators to determine whether or not a gender pay gap exists, and what its causes might be.

The use of unionized workers was helpful to the researchers because the rigid union rules meant that few pay decisions were left up to managers who might otherwise be blamed for bias in these cases.

As it is, the union rules provided clear rules for how seniority affects pay and setting of work hours.

This allowed the researchers to focus on the behavior of the workers themselves while largely ignoring the role of supervisor decisions.

The researchers did find that a gap existed:

The gap of $0.89 in oursetting, which is 60% of the earnings gap across the United States.

can be explained entirely by the fact that, while having the same choice sets in the workplace, women and men make different choices. Women use the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to take more unpaid timeoff than men and they work fewer overtime hours at 1.5 times the wage rate. At the root of these different choices is the fact that women value time and flexibility more than men. Men and women choose to work similar hours of overtime when it is scheduled a quarter in advance,but men work nearly twice as many overtime hours than women when they are scheduled theday before. Using W-4 filings to ascertain marital status and the presence of dependents, we show that women with dependents – especially single women – value time away from work more than men with dependents.

the earnings gap can be explained in our setting by the fact that men take48% fewer unpaid hours off and work 83% more overtime hours per year than women. Thereason for these differences is not that men and women face different choice sets in this job.Rather, it is that women have greater demand for workplace flexibility and lower demand for overtime work hours than men. These gender differences are consistent with women taking on more of the household and childcare duties than men, limiting their work availability in the process. … When overtime hours are scheduled three months in advance, men sign up for about 7%more of them than women. When overtime is scheduled the day before or the day of thenecessary shift, men work almost twice as many of those hours as women.

Women with dependents – single women in particular – are considerably less likely than men with dependents to accept an overtime opportunity. This is especially the case during weekends and after regular work hours, times when there are fewer childcare options available.

These insights are helpful in seeing some specific of how men and women behave in the workplace. They also help to highlight the fact that even when men and women have the same job title and the same job description, the work they do is not homogenous. A worker who works at odd hours (and thus makes more overtime pay because of it) simply isn’t doing the same work as a person who requires extremely regular hours. Similarly, a worker who requires sizable chunks of time off every several years (for maternity leave or childcare needs) is also not doing the same work as a worker who rarely takes time off.

If one of the workers is available nearly all the time, but the other one has a far more inflexible schedule, don’t have the same job when it comes to actual executions of duties.

Yet, we still continue to hear that “women are paid less to do the same work,” presumably because of gender bias. This latest study should help to expose, yet again, that this is an empirically untrue statement, and does not describe the nature of workplace behavior in the real world.

Moreover, this study found a pay gap in a single industry between workers doing similar work. How much more does the heterogeneity of work and workers explain an overall, nationwide “pay gap”? Nationwide, differences in work span across thousands of industries, jobs, and working conditions. The many differences in these cases are uncountable.

Leftists, of course, may see this data and argue that this shows women are still at a disadvantage because single women with children (which are more common than single men than children) are constrained in their choice of hours by childcare needs. Therefore, we need government policies to equalize this situation.

This is true, but only in the sense that, when it comes to earnings, people who work fewer hours are at a “disadvantage” compared to people who work longer hours. It is possible that policies forcing “equality” between people who can work longer, odder hours, and those who can’t, could help those who aren’t flexible. This, of course, would come at the expense of those who work odder hours right now.

But this is not at all a situation in which “women are paid less to do the same work.” And we should stop pretending that it is.

In fact, in a variety of settings, women earn more than men. As Andrew Syrios has noted :

When comparing never-married women with never married-men, the wage gap doesn’t just disappear, it flips. As far back as 1971, never-married women in their thirties have earned slightly more than similar men. 2 In 1982, never-married women on the whole earned 91 percent of what men do. 3 Today, among men and women living along from the age twenty-one to thirty-five, there is no wage gap.  And among unmarried college-educated men and women between forty and sixty-four, men earn an average of $40,000 a year and women earn an average of $47,000 a year! 5

And when all of this is taken into account, the wage gap all but disappears, as many studies have found:

A study by the CONSAD Research Corp. for the US Department of Labor found that once they controlled for the variables, there was “an adjusted gender wage gap that is between 4.8 percent and 7.1 percent.” 6

Warren Farrell conducted a thorough study reported in his book Why Men Earn More and found no evidence of a wage gap.

A 1983 study by Walter E. Williams and the aforementioned 1981 study by Walter Block discredit the idea that the wage gap is caused by discrimination.

Carrie Lukas notes that “In a 2010 study of single, childless urban workers between the ages of 22 and 30, the research firm Reach Advisors found that women earned an average of 8% more than their male counterparts.”

2113,"Belmont Stakes 2019 odds, field, complete betting guide","An inside look at how the 2019 Belmont  Stakes will shape up:

Current Form: Dialed back to 1 1/16 miles and won a 100k, wire to wire at Monmouth. Tired badly previously in the longer Wood Memorial.

Worth a wager? Most likely candidate to inherit the lead, then yield it, in a field of closers. Distance an issue. Loves it wet, trouble is there’s no rain in forecast. Last of 10.

Current Form: Career 1-for-11 but nearly shocked the racing world, placing second to War of Will in the Preakness after falling 22 lengths behind.

Worth a wager? Thought trainer Dale Romans had no business running him in the Preakness. I was wrong. Longer distance should entice betting public. Ugly spring preps tell us no. Ninth.

Current Form: Broke last of 19 at Churchill Downs before launching a nice run at 58-1 to get within four lengths of Maximum Security.

Worth a wager? Jockey Julien Leparoux after the Derby, “I needed another furlong.” Japan bred lost weight making trip overseas but raced well in Derby. Gets more ground. Gets outkicked. Eighth.

Current Form: Taxing trip (mud/traffic) riding the dreaded rail in the Derby and finished an invisible 15th. Only a length back of Tacitus in the Wood Memorial.

Worth a wager? Do we throw out the Derby and look back to his performance in the Wood? Trainer Danny Gargan after Tax’s last work: “He looked like a million dollars out there this morning.” Fifth.

Current Form: Never fought, running evenly midpack in the Preakness after taking an exorbitant amount of money at the windows, including unfortunately, this handicapper’s.

Worth a wager? I’ve soured. No-show had trainer Mark Hennig confused. “He wasn’t tired after the race. Held him for a bath and he bit me in the stomach. He was angry.” I’m angry too. Sixth.

Current Form: Ran to his odds of 52-1 in the Derby but was parked wide nearly the entire trip. Close second in the Louisiana Derby previously.

Worth a wager? No, he wasn’t going to win the Derby with a clean trip. Toss it nonetheless. Wins were earned sitting just off the pace. Javier Castellano will have him in the early mix. Seventh.

Current Form: Slow from the gate, he rallied boldly from 11 lengths back to place second in the Peter Pan at Belmont. Earned a triple-digit fig for his effort.

Worth a wager? Truest stretch runner in field will be hiding early then try to outkick Tacitus and War of Will. Trainer Mark Casse: “He’s truly a 1 ¹/₂ -mile horse.” At this price we’re in. Winner.

Current Form: Won his initial pair then showed third as favorite in the Peter Pan, about five lengths back of Sir Winston after a stumbling start.

Worth a wager? Had time to recover from the bad break but never did. Love Sir Winston, so he must be considered after the gate trouble. Todd Pletcher adds blinkers. Fourth.

Current Form: Showed his true ability powering off the pace to take the Preakness. Positioned to pounce in the Derby, but “the incident” at the top of the stretch forced him to check out.

Worth a wager? Fiasco forgotten. We all witnessed what “WOW” can do when given a clean lane. Casse said he’s put on 40-50 pounds since. Looms large late. Second.

Current Form: Made it three wins in a row in the Wood Memorial. Took impressive streak to Kentucky and made a late run for fourth (third via DQ) in the Derby.

Worth a wager? Solid effort at Churchill considering where he rallied from in the sloppy conditions. Bill Mott: “He ate a lot of mud.” M/L favorite is bred for distance. Third.","__label__Neutral"

Sometimes it can be difficult to tell the difference between a malignant melanoma and another benign skin condition so further testing, which delays the results, has to be done.
If, and it's a big if at the moment, it is diagnosed as melanoma then this will be discussed at a MDT meeting. I know that you want to know one way or another but the hospital is giving you a straight answer and that's that they don't know at the moment but further tests are being run.
I see that you have already joined the melanoma group and I know that you'll get plenty of support over there while you're waiting. I belong to that group having been diagnosed with melanoma nearly 2 years ago. For most of us the biopsy followed up by a wide local excision is all the treatment we need.

Plastic bottles and packaging make up a large portion of plastic waste in Japan. | GETTY IMAGES
The government will set a target to cut disposable plastic waste by 25 percent by 2030 while boosting the use of environmentally friendly bioplastics made from plants, sources close to the matter said Saturday.
By setting the ambitious goal, Tokyo aims to display its commitment to tackling environmental issues ahead of the summit of the Group of 20 economies in Osaka next June.
Japan produces the largest amount of plastic waste per capita after the United States and has lagged behind other countries in curbing the use of plastics such as disposable containers and shopping bags.
The target will likely be added to a draft strategy on plastic waste reduction being prepared by the Environment Ministry. It will be submitted to a ministry panel on Friday and the strategy is expected to be compiled by the end of the year.
The use of bioplastic materials will be increased to around 2 million tons by 2030 from 70,000 tons in fiscal 2013, according to the sources.
The draft did not specify the base year for the target.
Plastic bottles and packaging, which make up a large portion of plastic waste, totaled 4.07 million tons in 2016, according to the ministry. Overall plastic waste data including for straws and stirrers were not available.
Businesses voiced concerns about negative economic repercussions and the feasibility of the target.
It costs less than ¥1 to produce a plastic straw but around ¥13 for a paper straw, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Bioplastics are also more expensive than conventional plastics.
On the goal of boosting bioplastics by nearly 30 times by fiscal 2030, a government official said, “It is very ambitious and would be really tough to achieve.”
Among other goals, Japan aims to raise the proportion of recycled and reused plastic waste to 60 percent of all household and industrial waste. In fiscal 2016, the figure stood at 53 percent for household waste.
The Environment Ministry also plans to set targets for the reuse of all plastics including electronic appliances and automobile parts.
To achieve the goals, the government will make it mandatory for retail shops to charge for shopping bags and slash the use of microplastics in facial scrubs and toothpaste.
By stepping up monitoring of illegal dumping and encouraging investment in businesses taking environmentally friendly steps, the government eventually aims to completely halt the dumping of plastic items in the ocean.
The draft reflected numerical targets in the Ocean Plastic Charter that Japan and the United States refused to sign at the Group of Seven summit in June. The Japanese government draft set even more ambitious target years for recycling and other measures compared with the charter.","__label__Neutral"

439,"Tate Galleries Will Refuse Sackler Money Because of Opioid Links - The New York Times","The Tate Modern in London. The Tate galleries will no longer accept contributions connected to the Sackler family because of its links to opioid production.CreditCreditMike Kemp/in Pictures, via Getty Images
LONDON — Tate, which runs some of Britain’s most important art museums, announced Thursday night that it will no longer accept financial donations from the Sackler family, whose pharmaceutical interests have been linked to the opioid crisis.
“The Sackler family has given generously to Tate in the past, as they have to a large number of U.K. arts institutions,” a Tate statement said.
""We do not intend to remove references to this historic philanthropy. However, in the present circumstances we do not think it right to seek or accept further donations from the Sacklers.”
Tate’s trustees made the decision after advice from the institution’s independent ethics committee, a spokesman said in an email.
The news is the latest sign of the changing climate in the art world toward the Sacklers, who are major donors to museums. Family members own Purdue Pharma, which makes the painkiller OxyContin and is facing hundreds of lawsuits as a result of the epidemic of opioid addiction.
Tate’s statement came two days after Britain’s National Portrait Gallery said it would not accept a long-discussed $1.3 million donation from the London-based Sackler Trust, one of the family’s charitable foundations. It said the decision was taken jointly by the gallery and Trust.
But the Thursday announcement, affecting Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, as well as Tate Liverpool and Tate St. Ives in Cornwall, could have a bigger impact in the art world. All these galleries are major tourist attractions as well as home to large, high-profile exhibitions.
The communications adviser to the Sackler Trust did not immediately respond to a text message asking for comment. But the trust said this week that it “vigorously denied” allegations against the family in its statement that announced the National Portrait Gallery grant would not go ahead.
“To avoid being a distraction for the National Portrait Gallery, we have decided not to proceed at this time with the donation,” it said.
Much of the focus on the Sacklers’ donations to art institutions has been in the United States, where deaths and addiction associated with prescription opioids have become an unrelenting crisis. But awareness of the crisis is high in Britain, and that has led to pressure on galleries, with the news media asking frequent questions about donations from the Sacklers.
Tate has received over $5 million from Sackler family trusts, including the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation based in Britain, according to the BBC. The trust helped finance the 2016 extension to Tate Modern known as the Blavatnik Building
There was little immediate reaction to the news from other institutions in Britain or the United States. Ken Weine, vice president and chief communications officer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, said it was aware of Tate’s announcement but that the museum had nothing to add to a statement issued last month by Daniel Weiss, the Met’s president and chief executive.
“The Sackler family has been connected with the Met for more than a half century,” Mr. Weiss’s statement said. “The family is a large extended group and their support of The Met began decades before the opioid crisis.”
“The Met is currently engaging in a further review of our detailed gift acceptance policies, and we will have more to report in due course,” it went on to say.
The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and Foundation, which has also received money from members of the Sackler family, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","__label__Negative"
1659,"New Road(s) Depict Good Things for Amberley","Amberley is a flourishing community, and with the construction of a new ‘link road’ getting underway today (the second new link road in less than a year), it will also become a more connected community.

The new link road will be called ‘Anderson Street’ after local identity Mollie Anderson, in an acknowledgment of Mrs. Anderson’s momentous contribution and dedication to recycling in Amberley.

Consultant for the Hurunui District Council, Bruce Yates, described Mrs. Anderson as a “pioneer in recycling”, explaining she had a huge impact for Amberley.

“She and a few other concerned locals started up a recycling operation in Amberley in the early 1980s, when growing concerns about the state and future of landfills began to gain traction on a national scale… Mollie and her helpers accepted, sorted and disposed of recycling materials on Saturday mornings, initially from the old fire station but then at the council depot in Carters Road and the adjoining ‘Frew block’ over which this new street will run” he said. “Very few, if any, local body leaders in NZ would not have heard of Mollie Anderson and her inspirational leadership in environmental responsibility.”

Anderson Street will connect Saleyard Drive (which runs off Courage Road beside Farmlands) to Carters Road (SH 1) beside PGG Wrightson, creating an alternative link for pedestrians and motorists.

The recently built Johnson Avenue (connecting Hilton Street, off Pound Street, to Claremont Avenue in the Oakfields subdivision) is reportedly being very well utilised. This new street gives the community in South-East Amberley access through to the post office, the medical centre and the mall without the need to cross State Highway 1.

Amberley Councillor, Michael Ward, has spoken on the emergence of Johnson Avenue and Anderson Street, explaining they show Amberley linking together cohesively as it grows. “The new streets are all about community connectedness” he said.

CEO of the Hurunui District Council, Hamish Dobbie, said that the new streets are a really good indicator of ongoing growth. “The council has every confidence that this growth in Amberley will continue. The new streets demonstrate this positive economic strength in both the business and residential sectors.”

Construction of the new street has been awarded to Texco Excavating.

380,"How even the dirtiest industries can reach zero emissions by 2050","At an Australian steel mill, a massive solar farm that will be built nearby will soon help the factory run on 100% renewable power . It’s a sign of transition in an energy-intensive industry that has been one of the hardest to move to a low-carbon future.
A new report looks at some of the most polluting, and hardest to change, industries in the world–from steel, cement, and plastic production to shipping and airlines–and finds that it’s now both technically and financially feasible for those industries to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century. That’s something that will be necessary for the world to have a chance of limiting global warming to the key target of 1.5 degrees .
Some new technologies, such as new electric furnaces used to make steel, or plastic made from plant material, are still at an early stage. But they exist. “There is still more innovation that needs to happen,” says Jules Kortenhorst, CEO at the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute, one of the members of the Energy Transitions Commission , the group that published the report, called “Mission Possible.” “These technologies needs to be reduced in cost and they need to be deployed at scale. But what the report is saying is this does not require a breakthrough invention that we haven’t come up with yet. The technologies are viable.”
They can follow a similar path as technologies like wind and solar power, Kortenhorst says, which have dropped so steeply in price that it’s now more affordable in many parts of the U.S. to build a new wind or solar farm than to keep a coal plant running.
The group calculated that full decarbonization would cost less than 0.5% of GDP by midcentury, and that cost could be even lower with improvements in recycling and other changes. Consumer products would see only small impacts–a pair of jeans, for example, might cost a dollar more if it traveled from a factory across the ocean on a zero-emissions ship. A bottle of soda might cost one cent more in a plastic bottle made with zero emissions.
Some changes are happening more quickly than expected. “If you had asked me five years ago, maybe even two years ago, I would have said it’s really hard to imagine how we’re going to take care of trucking without greenhouse gas emissions,” says Kortenhorst. Semi trucks that need to travel long distances without stopping are harder to convert to electricity than a car that makes a short commute each day. But the falling cost of technology is making it possible. Both zero-carbon buses and trucks, running on batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, are likely to be cost-competitive with fossil fuel trucks by 2030.
On short flights, airlines can begin to shift to electric planes , while biofuels and synthetic jet fuels can cover long flights. Cargo trucks can use electricity and batteries or fuel cells for short trips, and biofuels (or, in the long term, hydrogen) for long trips.
The plastics industry can shift to bio-based plastic. Moving to a circular economy –with far more recycling of plastic–could cut primary plastic production by 56% compared to a business-as-usual scenario, making it far easier to cut the industry’s footprint. In the steel industry, a more circular economy would also substantially reduce the carbon footprint of steel.
The changes, of course, are not inevitable. A combination of new policy and industry commitments, and consumer change–including just recycling more–is necessary. “What this report illustrates very clearly is that the technologies and the business solutions exist today to decarbonize most of our economy in a cost-effective manner,” says Kortenhorst. “But there is a crucial role for policymakers, for consumers, and for the private sector to start shifting towards those low carbon technologies of the future, and it is all of our joint responsibility to drive that transition as fast as we can.”

968,"Did Paris Hilton Return Her Engagement Ring? Chris Zylka May Want The $2 Million Rock Back","Did Paris Hilton Return Her Engagement Ring? Chris Zylka May Want The $2 Million Rock Back

Are you guys ready for the surprise of the year? Make sure you're sitting down for this one. OK, deep breath. Paris Hilton and Chris Zylka have officially ended their engagement. Are you in disbelief right now? And, with any broken off celebrity engagement, the big question revolves around the big piece of bling that used to sit on a particular ring finger — you know what I'm talking about. So, did Paris Hilton return her engagement ring? Considering the rock costs a whopping $2 million, many fans are wondering whether or not she gave it back to her ex-fiancé.

Well, according to TMZ, Hilton hasn't given Zylka the ring back, which for some reason isn't exactly a shocker. The site notes that Zylka hasn't asked for the ring back yet, as they haven't seen each other since their breakup. But let's be real: I can't imagine anyone simply letting a $2 million piece of jewelry just simply float away from them without putting up a fight.

Paris Hilton and Chris Zylka called it quits after a 10-month engagement and two years of dating. According to Entertainment Tonight, the couple officially ended things back in November 2018. Elite Daily reached out to Zylka and Hilton’s team for comment on the report, but did not hear back by the time of publication.

A source close to the situation revealed exclusively to Just Jared that their relationship started to go downhill, which led to their called-off engagement.

""They broke up and called off their engagement earlier this month,"" the source revealed, adding, ""Their relationship started to become off-kilter after about two years together.""

It doesn't seem like our girl Paris is too heartbroken though, after taking to Instagram to post a picture of herself looking like Marilyn Monroe and sharing one of her favorite quotes by the late actress. She wrote,

My favorite Marilyn Monroe quote. ✨”I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go. Things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they're right. You believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself. And sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.”✨

But she might be singing a different tune if she has to fork over that little (read: massive) 20-carat diamond to her ex. Sources told TMZ t hat Zylka bought the ring at a discount, since the jeweler who created the ring has a close relationship with Paris Hilton, and knew that having her flaunt the ring around town is pretty great publicity.

If you've yet to witness the glistening diamond on Paris' finger, then let me do you a solid:

Mhm. Now you see why both parties would like to keep that sparkly fortune.

If you prefer to look back on the good times, back when the ring was rightfully Hilton's, then perhaps you'd like to remember back when Zylka first proposed back in January 2018. Hilton took to Instagram to share the news of her engagement in a now-deleted Instagram post. She wrote,

I said Yas!  So happy &amp; excited to be engaged to the love of my life. My best friend &amp; soulmate. Perfect for me in every way. So dedicated, loyal, loving &amp; kindhearted. I feel like the luckiest girl in the world! You are my dream come true! Thank you for showing me that fairytales do exist.

It's a bummer that their love didn't last, but I have a feeling that Paris Hilton is going to be A-OK, with or without her absurdly large engagement ring.","__label__Neutral"
1298,"WhatsApp has an encrypted child porn problem","WhatsApp chat groups are being used to spread illegal child pornography, cloaked by the app’s end-to-end encryption. Without the necessary number of human moderators, the disturbing content is slipping by WhatsApp’s automated systems. A report from two Israeli NGOs reviewed by TechCrunch details how third-party apps for discovering WhatsApp groups include “Adult” sections that offer invite links to join rings of users trading images of child exploitation. TechCrunch has reviewed materials showing many of these groups are currently active.
TechCrunch’s investigation shows that Facebook could do more to police WhatsApp and remove this kind of content. Even without technical solutions that would require a weakening of encryption, WhatsApp’s moderators should have been able to find these groups and put a stop to them. Groups with names like “child porn only no adv” and “child porn xvideos” found on the group discovery app “Group Links For Whats” by Lisa Studio don’t even attempt to hide their nature. And a screenshot provided by anti-exploitation startup AntiToxin reveals active WhatsApp groups with names like “Children ” or “videos cp” — a known abbreviation for ‘child pornography’.
A screenshot from today of active child exploitation groups on WhatsApp. Phone numbers and photos redacted. Provided by AntiToxin .
Better manual investigation of these group discovery apps and WhatsApp itself should have immediately led these groups to be deleted and their members banned. While Facebook doubled its moderation staff from 10,000 to 20,000 in 2018 to crack down on election interference, bullying and other policy violations, that staff does not moderate WhatsApp content. With just 300 employees, WhatsApp runs semi-independently, and the company confirms it handles its own moderation efforts. That’s proving inadequate for policing a 1.5 billion-user community.
The findings from the NGOs Screen Savers and Netivei Reshe were written about today by Financial Times , but TechCrunch is publishing the full report , their translated letter to Facebook,  translated emails with Facebook, their police report , plus the names of child pornography groups on WhatsApp and group discovery apps listed above. A startup called AntiToxin Technologies  that researches the topic has backed up the report, providing the screenshot above and saying it’s identified more than 1,300 videos and photographs of minors involved in sexual acts on WhatsApp groups. Given that Tumblr’s app was recently temporarily removed from the Apple App Store for allegedly harboring child pornography, we’ve asked Apple if it will temporarily suspend WhatsApp, but have not heard back. 
In July 2018, the NGOs became aware of the issue after a man reported to one of their hotlines that he’d seen hardcore pornography on WhatsApp. In October, they spent 20 days cataloging more than 10 of the child pornography groups, their content and the apps that allow people to find them.
The NGOs began contacting Facebook’s head of Policy, Jordana Cutler, starting September 4th. They requested a meeting four times to discuss their findings. Cutler asked for email evidence but did not agree to a meeting, instead following Israeli law enforcement’s guidance to instruct researchers to contact the authorities. The NGO reported their findings to Israeli police but declined to provide Facebook with their research. WhatsApp only received their report and the screenshot of active child pornography groups today from TechCrunch.
Listings from a group discovery app of child exploitation groups on WhatsApp. URLs and photos have been redacted.
WhatsApp tells me it’s now investigating the groups visible from the research we provided. A Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch, “Keeping people safe on Facebook is fundamental to the work of our teams around the world. We offered to work together with police in Israel to launch an investigation to stop this abuse.” A statement from the Israeli Police’s head of the Child Online Protection Bureau, Meir Hayoun, notes that: “In past meetings with Jordana, I instructed her to always tell anyone who wanted to report any pedophile content to contact the Israeli police to report a complaint.”
A WhatsApp spokesperson tells me that while legal adult pornography is allowed on WhatsApp, it banned 130,000 accounts in a recent 10-day period for violating its policies against child exploitation. In a statement, WhatsApp wrote that:
WhatsApp has a zero-tolerance policy around child sexual abuse. We deploy our most advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, to scan profile photos and images in reported content, and actively ban accounts suspected of sharing this vile content. We also respond to law enforcement requests around the world and immediately report abuse to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Sadly, because both app stores and communications services are being misused to spread abusive content, technology companies must work together to stop it.
But it’s that over-reliance on technology and subsequent under-staffing that seems to have allowed the problem to fester. AntiToxin’s CEO Zohar Levkovitz tells me, “Can it be argued that Facebook has unwittingly growth-hacked pedophilia? Yes. As parents and tech executives we cannot remain complacent to that.”
WhatsApp introduced an invite link feature for groups in late 2016, making it much easier to discover and join groups without knowing any members. Competitors like Telegram had benefited as engagement in their public group chats rose. WhatsApp likely saw group invite links as an opportunity for growth, but didn’t allocate enough resources to monitor groups of strangers assembling around different topics. Apps sprung up to allow people to browse different groups by category. Some usage of these apps is legitimate, as people seek communities to discuss sports or entertainment. But many of these apps now feature “Adult” sections that can include invite links to both legal pornography-sharing groups as well as illegal child exploitation content.
A WhatsApp spokesperson tells me that it scans all unencrypted information on its network — basically anything outside of chat threads themselves — including user profile photos, group profile photos and group information. It seeks to match content against the PhotoDNA banks of indexed child pornography that many tech companies use to identify previously reported inappropriate imagery. If it finds a match, that account, or that group and all of its members, receive a lifetime ban from WhatsApp.
If imagery doesn’t match the database but is suspected of showing child exploitation, it’s manually reviewed. If found to be illegal, WhatsApp bans the accounts and/or groups, prevents it from being uploaded in the future and reports the content and accounts to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The one example group reported to WhatsApp by Financial Times was already flagged for human review by its automated system, and was then banned along with all 256 members.
To discourage abuse, WhatsApp says it limits groups to 256 members and purposefully does not provide a search function for people or groups within its app. It does not encourage the publication of group invite links and the vast majority of groups have six or fewer members. It’s already working with Google and Apple to enforce its terms of service against apps like the child exploitation group discovery apps that abuse WhatsApp. Those kind of groups already can’t be found in Apple’s App Store, but remain available on Google Play. We’ve contacted Google Play to ask how it addresses illegal content discovery apps and whether Group Links For Whats by Lisa Studio will remain available, and will update if we hear back. [Update 3pm PT: Google has not provided a comment but the Group Links For Whats app by Lisa Studio has been removed from Google Play. That’s a step in the right direction.]
But the larger question is that if WhatsApp was already aware of these group discovery apps, why wasn’t it using them to track down and ban groups that violate its policies. A spokesperson claimed that group names with “CP” or other indicators of child exploitation are some of the signals it uses to hunt these groups, and that names in group discovery apps don’t necessarily correlate to the group names on WhatsApp. But TechCrunch then provided a screenshot showing active groups within WhatsApp as of this morning, with names like “Children ” or “videos cp”. That shows that WhatsApp’s automated systems and lean staff are not enough to prevent the spread of illegal imagery.
The situation also raises questions about the trade-offs of encryption as some governments like Australia seek to prevent its usage by messaging apps. The technology can protect free speech, improve the safety of political dissidents and prevent censorship by both governments and tech platforms. However, it also can make detecting crime more difficult, exacerbating the harm caused to victims.
WhatsApp’s spokesperson tells me that it stands behind strong end-to-end encryption that protects conversations with loved ones, doctors and more. They said there are plenty of good reasons for end-to-end encryption and it will continue to support it. Changing that in any way, even to aid catching those that exploit children, would require a significant change to the privacy guarantees it’s given users. They suggested that on-device scanning for illegal content would have to be implemented by phone makers to prevent its spread without hampering encryption.
But for now, WhatsApp needs more human moderators willing to use proactive and unscalable manual investigation to address its child pornography problem. With Facebook earning billions in profit per quarter and staffing up its own moderation ranks, there’s no reason WhatsApp’s supposed autonomy should prevent it from applying adequate resources to the issue. WhatsApp sought to grow through big public groups, but failed to implement the necessary precautions to ensure they didn’t become havens for child exploitation. Tech companies like WhatsApp need to stop assuming cheap and efficient technological solutions are sufficient. If they want to make money off huge user bases, they must be willing to pay to protect and police them.","__label__Neutral"
1853,"Zion Williamson doesn’t miss shot in return as Duke drubs Syracuse","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Zion Williamson made all 13 of his shots, five on high-flying dunks, and scored 29 points in his return to lead No. 5 Duke to an 84-72 victory over Syracuse on Thursday night in the Atlantic Coast Conference quarterfinals.

RJ Barrett added 23 points and six rebounds to help Duke (27-5) set up a semifinal showdown with No. 3 North Carolina. The Tar Heels swept both games from the Blue Devils in the regular season, with Williamson injured in the first minute of the first meeting.

Williamson got off to a rousing start two minutes into the game when he stole a pass and drove the length of the floor before cocking his right hand back and throwing down a highlight-reel dunk that brought the crowd to its feet. He added three more soaring dunks in the first half — including one off an alley-oop pass from Barrett — and finished the first half with 21 points on 9-of-9 shooting and nine rebounds as Duke built a 34-28 lead.

Did Syracuse star Frank Howard just intentionally try to trip...

It was Williamson’s first game since his left Nike Paul George shoe broke during a Feb. 20 game against the Tar Heels, causing him to miss nearly six full games with a sprained right knee. Williamson wore modified Nike Kyrie 4’s this time specifically designed to lend extra support to his 6-foot-7, 285-pound frame.

He showed no signs of any lingering knee issue and cracked a smile several times throughout the game.

Frank Howard, who appeared to try to trip up Zion Williamson after a dunk by the Duke star during the game, scored 28 points, and Buddy Boeheim had 15 for Syracuse (20-13).

Despite Williamson’s highlight-reel display, the Orange battled until the end without leading scorer Tyus Battle, who missed his second straight game with a back injury.

Syracuse tied it with 13 minutes remaining on back-to-back 3-pointers from Boeheim.

But Duke wore down Syracuse down the stretch between the inside game of Williamson and the shooting of Barrett, who punctuated the win with a windmill dunk with 1:14 remaining.

Tre Jones added 15 points and eight assists for Duke.","__label__Neutral"

In the two years since they've publicly been together, Lopez and Rodriguez are constantly showing each other plenty of affection on social media and supporting each other at big events. Don't believe me? Check out Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez's body language at the 2019 Grammys , because it's proof that these two are totally there for each other through it all. You'd think they've been together for 20 years, instead of just two!
At Sunday night's Grammys, Lopez was out in full force. Not only did she serve some serious fashion looks on the red carpet, but she also took to the stage to belt out a highly talked-about Motown performance . Rodriguez was all over his lady on the red carpet, but you should've seen his face as he watched her on stage doing her thing. Seriously, his picture belongs in the dictionary next to ""Doting Partner.""
Considering how in love the two seem on social media and at public events, does their body language reflect the personas they portray? Do J.Lo and A-Rod have what it takes to make their love last? Body language expert Patti Wood breaks it down, so read on.
According to Wood, Lopez really stood out on the red carpet, and Rodriguez totally supported her. ""She is in all-out model pose,"" Wood explains. ""I have been analyzing her body language for a long time and she likes to pull away or step away from her partner and be seen and noticed first, and here she does just that, leaning back and away from him, shoulder back.""
More, Wood says that Lopez's accessories are saying more than you might first think. ""Even her hat, called a 'nonverbal artifact,' makes her the center of the focus and keeps him from drawing closer in this photos. He slightly leans into her with his upper body and head, but keeps the fingers of his hand on her waist and hip slightly away and open as if he might break her.""
Sure, they aren't smiling wide and acting all lovey-dovey , but that doesn't mean they aren't connected.
2He wants her to be happy.
Grammys night is very much considered music's biggest night, and seeing as how Lopez is a musical icon, it's safe to say Rodriguez knew Lopez was going to take center stage. ""Here you see him focus on her expressions to see how she is and what she wants,"" she says. ""Note the way his hand and fingers are spread out.""
Wood says that ""in this moment, he wants to do as she would like. Remember this is her event, her industry rather than his so you see him show that."" Again, Rodriguez is totally OK with letting his bae shine, and that's pretty awesome.
3He can still take charge.
Finally, Wood says that Rodriguez and Lopez still have a balanced partnership, taking turns taking the lead. ""He is leading the way,"" Wood says, about this photo. ""Over the years we haven’t seen a lot of men leading her,"" she adds, so it's interesting to see Rodriguez take charge. ""Now we see him leading her, showing he is in charge, showing their relationship has two power people in it,"" Wood explains.
Looking gorgeous as ever, the body language between these two proves that Rodriguez is just as caring and doting as he looks in photos, but he can still be an anchor for her in their relationship. Nothing like a strong and steady Hollywood romance to restore your faith in love!","__label__Positive"

Instead, the Oreo Music Box on Amazon swaps actual records for Oreo cookies and uses them to play music. Therefore, I'll probably ask for a package of Oreos that I can jam out to this holiday season. If you've got music-loving friends with a sweet tooth, you might want to consider buying them an Oreo Music Box instead of taking a group trip to the record store this year. You'll get snacks and live tunes — so it's a total win-win.
If you're a little confused about how the Oreo Music Box works, it's totally OK; the idea of an Oreo cookie playing music is a little far-fetched, so I'll explain how to use it. But first, I'll show you where to buy it, because the package includes everything you'll need in order to start spinning vinyl — er, I mean, cookies. In order to land your own Oreo Music Box, head to Amazon and buy it for $19.99 . The entire package that you'll receive will have five Oreo cookie packs inside of it, which will include one pack of original Oreos, three packs of Oreo Thins, and one pack of White Fudge Oreos (YUM). It'll also include the actual Oreo turntable and a collectable holiday Oreo tin.
Alright: Now that you know what to expect when you order an Oreo Music Box, I can tell you how to use it. Apparently, it's super easy to do — and you won't even have to worry about scratching any records. According to Oreo, you'll first need to place an Oreo cookie on the turntable. Then, you'll need to slide the record arm over the Oreo (just like you would do if you were using an actual record player). After that, music will start to play. Sure, it might not play Billboard's Hot 100 — but it'll be music coming from a freaking cookie, so it'll be cool AF.
What's even cooler about the turntable is that it'll change the song with every bite you take out of the Oreo. So, if you're listening to music and start getting hungry, you can pick up the cookie and take a bite. When you put it back down onto the turntable, a new song will play. According to Oreo, new songs will keep playing as your cookie gets smaller and smaller — so you're basically the DJ of any party that you bring your Oreo Music Box to.
If you aren't feeling the music, you have another option that's just as fun. According to a video on the Oreo Music Box Amazon page , customers can record their own messages to play while an Oreo is on the turntable. So if you'd rather play your own voice during a holiday party (or sing your own song into the player), you can easily do so.
As you can see, the Oreo Music Box is a fun way to play music while simultaneously snacking on America's favorite cookie. If you're hoping to grab one this holiday season, head to Amazon and start jamming out.","__label__Positive"

After trading places with fellow All-Star Kawhi Leonard, the former Toronto Raptors hoops king talks about joining the vaunted San Antonio Spurs.
DeMar DeRozan was just as shocked as everyone else when he was traded for Kawhi Leonard from the Toronto Raptors to the San Antonio Spurs. As one of the most talented hoops stars in the game, DeRozan talked life after Toronto and the adjustments he’ll need to make in a new interview.
Chris Haynes: DeMar DeRozan, the newest member of the San Antonio Spurs. What was this past week like for you?
DeMar DeRozan: Man, it was a blur. It was a dream … still kind of feel like a dream right now. But it’s been tough having this roller coaster — up and down — just trying to get acclimated to changing teams.
CH: It caught a lot of people off-guard. Looked like it caught you off-guard as well. Masai Ujiri, the Raptors GM, came out in a news conference and said it was a gap in communication: that he spoke with you during summer league in Las Vegas and thinks his mistake was talking to you about what to expect moving forward with the organization. From your standpoint, is that an accurate assessment of that conversation?
DD: Um, no, because all summer through the talks we had — through the talks he had with my agent — you know, it seemed like I was in that discussion of moving forward with the team. My whole approach every summer was preparing, going out there and supporting the young guys at summer league, figuring out ways I can be better, make my team better, and that was the gist of the conversations we had with moving forward. Having the opportunity to do something special all over again, you know? So that was my mindset and everybody around me’s mindset as well.

835,"Budget talks sticking point: How many people ICE can detain - CNN","Border security talks hit an impasse over the weekend, as Democrats pushed back against another facet of the Trump administration's agenda to crack down on immigration: aggressive detention efforts by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The sticking point: Democrats argue that by allowing ICE to up the number of detention beds from 40,520 to 52,000, as the administration wants, the agency will have the capacity to pursue a larger swath of undocumented immigrants, including those without criminal records. They want to go down to 35,520 for the remainder of fiscal year 2019.

But Republicans view the number of detention beds as central to limiting the ability of detained undocumented immigrants to be released into the US as they await hearings.

President Donald Trump is expected to hold a meeting in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon to discuss wall funding as well as a response to Democrats who are demanding a limit on the detention of illegal immigrants. Republican lawmakers are not expected to attend the meeting. Earlier today, Trump aide Stephen Miller led a briefing call along with administration insiders denouncing the Democrats' demands, according to a source close to the White House.

ICE, the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement arm, is tasked with, among other things, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants residing in the United States. To do so, the agency contracts with county jails and private companies, which operate the facilities where many of the beds are.

Beds are just that -- beds for undocumented immigrants in detention. To that end, the number of beds is representative of how many undocumented immigrants, whether they have criminal convictions or not, can be detained. Costs per bed include the expense of keeping each person in detention, including payments for guards, health care, building maintenance and administrative overhead, ICE says.

Not every detention bed is alike. The cost can vary significantly depending on who is being detained. According to ICE's fiscal year 2018 budget, the daily rate for an adult bed is $133.99. Family beds -- a bed in a family detention center that's suitable for children -- cost around $319 day on average.

In a call with reporters Monday, acting ICE Deputy Director Matt Albence cast any cap as a threat to security. ""It'll be extremely damaging to the public safety of this country,"" Albence said. ""If we are forced to live within a cap based on interior arrests, we'll immediately be forced to release criminal aliens that are currently sitting in our custody.""

Detention facilities are key to ICE's operations: As of January 1, more than 48,000 individuals were in ICE custody, surpassing the 40,520 beds for which it's received funding. The influx of individuals in ICE custody is in line with Trump's agenda to prioritize enforcement in the interior of the country, not just at the border.

In fiscal year 2018, for example, ICE held an average of more than 42,000 people in custody. The previous record high since ICE began tracking the data in 2001 was just over 38,000 in 2017.

According to the agency, the majority of those arrested by ICE had criminal convictions (many of which are traffic offenses), followed by pending criminal charges, or previously issued final orders of removal.

Some of those booked are also people who had crossed the border illegally. According to ICE statistics , ""book-ins to detention resulting from (Customs and Border Protection) arrests increased by 32%"" in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.

Trump has repeatedly criticized the practice of releasing undocumented immigrants as they wait their immigration court hearings, which are oftentimes scheduled years down the line due to a massive backlog. (That backlog increased during the recent partial government shutdown.)

The White House and Republicans see the addition of detention beds as a way to prevent that. But there are still limitations: Children and families, who now make up the majority of apprehensions, can't be held for more than 20 days as a result of the decades-old settlement agreement Flores v. Reno . (The administration has tried to amend the agreement.)

Even with more detention beds, the administration would be limited in how long it can detain people.

Democrats are seeking to cap the number of detention beds at 35,520 for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 and cap the number that can be used to detain individuals who were already in the US at 16,500 in an attempt to return to the level of interior detentions at the end of the Obama administration.

""A cap on ICE detention beds will force the Trump administration to prioritize deportation for criminals and people who pose real security threats, not law-abiding immigrants who are contributing to our country,"" said Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, the chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and a member of the House-Senate Conference Committee on Homeland Security.

But the Trump administration has stood firm on its ask for 52,000 detention beds. During the last shutdown, the White House sent a letter to Congress including the request, citing an uptick in border apprehensions. Nearly 48,000 people were apprehended at the southern border last month, compared with nearly 26,000 in January 2018, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.

The National Sheriffs' Association and the Major County Sheriffs of America denounced the cap in a letter to House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-New York, and the committee's top Republican, Kay Granger of Texas. Local law enforcement has a vested interest in ICE's detention capacity, given that the agency works with county jails across the country to detain undocumented immigrants.

""Any legislation that reduces ICE's detention capacity would hinder its ability to perform its national security and public safety missions, but also impact local law enforcement's ability to protect the communities they serve,"" the letter states. ""In order to meet the cap being tentatively proposed by Congress, ICE would be compelled to release thousands of aliens from custody.""

The House and Senate are scheduled to come back on Monday afternoon, but all eyes will be on what, if anything, the 17 conference committee members have to say publicly. The top four members of the House and Senate panels are expected to meet at some point to make a final push toward a deal, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN .

House Democrats might also move forward with a stopgap funding bill of some sort as a backstop if talks stall.

Trump has a campaign rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night.

909,"Pocket rocket wins 25th annual Car of the Year award","Now in its 25th year, the AMI NZ Autocar Car of the Year awards are back with the supreme winner revealed today (February 25).

The Suzuki Swift Sport has been named the 2018 Car of the Year following analysis by some of the country’s most respected figures in the motoring community.

NZ Autocar editor and head judge, Kyle Cassidy, says it’s exciting that the Swift Sport has taken out the supreme award considering its versatility as a family vehicle and a peppy performer on the road.

“It's a mild mannered commuter in the city with a turbocharged engine, balancing fuel economy with ease of driving, but then it delivers thrilling performance when you want. It's simple thrilling fun to drive.

“It's styled to impress, as does the level of standard specification and safety gear,” Cassidy says. “That it all costs less than $30,000 and comes with a 5-star ANCAP rating is amazing.”

Throughout the year, a range of vehicles are tested and given an overall score out of 100. The same rating system is used on the final judging day, which took place on February 12 at the Clevedon Hotel, south of Auckland. Those vehicles with the highest scores at the end of the year are awarded class wins.

“The six category winners are chosen from more than 130 vehicles tested and come together for the final back-to-back drive-off around rural Clevedon in south Auckland, to determine the overall winner,” Cassidy explains.

“On the day each vehicle is scored on aspects of design, performance, driving dynamics, practicality and value, with a maximum of 100 points available.

“The scoring system is weighted towards a vehicle’s particular strength in order that a supermini can be compared fairly with a six-figure luxury contender,” Cassidy says. “It’s a system that has proved robust as the winners over the last decade have come for a variety of different categories including the Mazda CX-9 and Honda Civic Type R, Ford Ranger and Ford Fiesta, and Volvo XC-90 and VW Golf.”

As well as the supreme winner, AMI and NZ Autocar have announced the winners in seven categories, including the AMI Safety Award – the Mercedes Benz A-Class.

“The AMI NZ Autocar Safety Award recognises the safest car released during the past year. This is based on how the vehicles fared in local crash testing, reviewing the Australasian New Car Assessment Programme (ANCAP) results,” Cassidy explains.

“The list of safety features for the A-Class is long, including the fact that there are nine airbags,” Cassidy says. “It has an active bonnet, auto emergency braking (AEB) (?), electronic stability control (ESP) (?), a driver attention monitor, blind spot monitoring, crash responsive emergency lighting and first-aid kit, active lane keeping and traffic sign recognition.

“There’s also a Pre-Safe accident anticipation system in which the car senses a crash is imminent and prepares the occupants for the worst (pretensions safety belts, closes windows and panoramic roof), reducing the risk of potential injury,” Cassidy says.

AMI’s Eve Whitwell says the AMI Safety Award is a good indicator for consumers when it comes to purchasing a new vehicle.

“The Mercedes Benz should be acknowledged for its work in helping protect those most vulnerable on the road, with the A-Class achieving the highest ever pedestrian protection rating, and equalling the highest Child Occupant Protection rating too.""

Whitwell says the news that the Swift Sport has taken out the supreme award is welcome news considering its versatility and affordability.

“We realise that some vehicles may be out of reach for the average New Zealand family, so it’s important to highlight the best in innovative approaches to safety. It’s fantastic to see the Swift take out the supreme award knowing it’s an affordable option for Kiwis wanting to keep themselves, their family and other drivers safe on the road.

“Before Kiwis buy their next vehicle, we really encourage everyone to check rightcar.govt.nz to check the safety rating,” she says.

What the judges said: “Seat's Ibiza is an overachiever for a small car. It backs up its sporty styling with agile dynamics and a goer of an engine that can be as economical as it can be exciting. It offers good value in standard guise while offering options for those that want to add more to this small car gem.”

$30,000 - $45,000 category winner: Kia Niro HEV

What the judges said: “The Niro is stellar value, and being a hybrid its fuel economy is excellent. We liked its practicalities as well as its levels of refinement and safety. It looks good and drives well too meaning you don't have to compromise on anything to own a highly efficient SUV.”

$45,000 - $60,000 category winner: Subaru Forester Premium

What the judges said: “The Forester is purpose built for New Zealanders who want to get out and see this great country. There's a spacious, feature packed cabin while Subaru's AWD underpinnings give it the ability to go further. Yet it's still right at home in the city where it comforts occupants and keeps them safe with its myriad safety features. And it's got a great price tag too.”

$60,000 - $100,000 category winner: Mazda CX-8 Limited

What the judges said: “The CX-8 impresses with a level of refinement and quality that genuinely stands up to comparison with vehicles from premium makers costing much more. And it offers a raft of features some of those makes would charge more for as options. It has top safety creds as well. It’s a versatile load lugger come school bus, but also drives well with a peachy powertrain.”

What the judges said: “The Cayenne S is a technological tour de force wrapped in luxury, masquerading as a sportscar. That something so large and luxurious can drive so convincingly is quite an achievement. And that it can pull a 3.5 tonne load off road is something else.”

What the judges said: “The new affordable performance benchmark, the Swift Sport does so much right. It's a mild mannered commuter in the city, it's turbocharged engine balancing fuel economy with ease of driving, but then it delivers thrilling performance when you want. It's simple thrilling fun to drive. It's styled to impress, as does the level of standard specification and safety gear. That it all costs less than $30,000 and comes with a 5-star ANCAP rating is amazing.”

What the judges said: “The AMI Safety Award recognises the safest car released during the past year, and this year the winner was the Mercedes-Benz A-Class. For cumulative score, taking into account child protection (91 per cent), safety assist features (73 per cent) and vulnerable road user protection (92 per cent), it was the Mercedes A-Class that produced the best overall performance.

“One of the most important safety aspects of the new A-Class and one that’s easily overlooked, is the AI-driven Siri-like assistant, summoned with the ‘Hey Mercedes’ command. ‘She’ can assist the driver with tasks that might otherwise be distracting, like changing radio station or temperature setting, inputting a sat nav destination, and even suggesting alternative routes if traffic is heavy. It’s essentially the icing on the safety cake for the new A-Class.”

Electric Vehicle of the Year: Volkswagen e-Golf

What the judges said: “The e-Golf impressed us as a discreet EV package, looking like any other Golf as opposed to a visual oddity. It is one of the least expensive new EVs and comes comprehensively specified. Its range is sufficient, and drives much like a regular Golf, but with more oomph around town, and it’s so quiet and refined.”

What the judges said: “The Kawasaki Ninja 400 can take on more expensive machinery and still hold its head high. It has vibrant performance, a terrific gearbox and good brakes backed by ABS. It handles and rides with poise and precision, looks great and even manages good economy. It represents unprecedented value.”

447,"Streaming accounted for nearly half of music revenues worldwide in 2018 - TechCrunch","The scales are about to tip in favor of streaming music becoming the number one driver of global recorded music revenues — a shift that appears to be on track for sometime this year. According to a new industry report, global recorded music revenues jumped 9.7 percent in 2018 to reach $19.1 billion — up from $17.4 billion in 2017. Streaming music revenues, in particular, now account for nearly half (47 percent) of global revenue, thanks to a sizable 32.9 percent jump in paid streaming last year. This brought streaming revenues to $8.9 million in 2018, and puts them on track for a further jump in 2019.
This is the fourth consecutive year of growth for the global music market, and the highest rate of growth since IFPI — the music industry trade group behind the new report — first started tracking the market in 1997.
Paid streaming accounted for the majority of streaming’s contribution to revenues, with a 37 percent share of the market versus ad-supported streaming’s 10 percent share.
At year-end, there were 255 million users of paid subscription streaming accounts, the report found.
Meanwhile, physical disks dropped 10.1 percent over the past year, to account for 24.7 percent of revenues. Within that segment, vinyl is still growing — it posted its 13th consecutive year of growth, to reach a 3.6 share of the market. But it couldn’t make up for the fact that physical format revenue, overall, still declined.
As consumers drop physical disks, they continue to turn to digital.
Digital revenues grew by 21.1 percent in 2018 to reach $11.2 billion — which represents the first time they’ve crossed the $10 billion mark, the report noted. Within this category, streaming grew by 34 percent to reach $8.9 billion (~$7 billion was paid subscription streaming), while downloads declined 21.2 percent to 7.7 percent of the market.
In 38 markets, digital makes up more than half of revenues, the report said.
Revenues from performance rights and synchronization revenue (the use of music in TV, movies, games and ads), represented a 14 percent and 2.3 percent share of the total music market, respectively.
North America, in particular, posted another year of double-digit revenue growth with a 14 percent jump, with strong streaming growth (33.4 percent) offsetting the physical revenue declines (-22 percent).
Asia and Australia overtook Europe to become the second largest global region for revenues with 11.7 percent growth. And Latin America was the fastest growing region, with 16.8 percent growth.
In order, the top markets by revenue were: the U.S., Japan, the U.K., Germany, France, South Korea, China, Australia, Canada and Brazil.","__label__Positive"
735,"Biden has been on wrong side of foreign policy issues for decades: former Bush assistant secretary of state - Fox News","Former assistant Secretary of State Robert Charles says the 2020 presidential hopeful has a history of poor judgement on foreign policy.

A former assistant secretary of state for President George W. Bush slammed Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden for dismissing the threat of China, saying the former vice president has been on the wrong side of foreign policy issues for the last four decades.

“On a personal level is he a friendly guy, but he has empirically had poor judgment particularly on foreign policy.. the examples are numerous,” Robert Charles said Friday on “ Fox and Friends.""

AS BIDEN DOWNPLAYS CHINA THREAT, ROMNEY HAS A NEW WARNING

Biden drew bipartisan fury after expressing lack of concern over as a global competitor to the U.S. and mocked those taking the Chinese threat at a rally on Wednesday.

“China is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man!” Biden exclaimed. “The fact that they have this great division between the China Sea and the mountains in the East -- I mean in the West. They can't figure out how they're going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. They're not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they're not competition for us.”

Reacting to those remarks, Trump said Biden was among many politicians “naïve” over China. “For somebody to be so naive, and say China's not a problem – if Biden actually said that, that's a very dumb statement.”

Charles went on to list Biden’s foreign policy failures, ranging from opposition to military programs that brought down the Soviet Union to opposing the Usama Bin Laden raid.

“If you go back in time this is a guy who wanted to divide up Iraq. He opposed the Bin Laden raid. In favor of the phony Iran deal and sending cash to them,” the former assistant secretary of state said.

TRUMP TELLS DEMS 'IT'S OVER,' SAYS MCGAHN WON'T TESTIFY, HITS BIDEN'S 'VERY DUMB STATEMENT' IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW

“Back in 1979, this is a guy who celebrated the Ayatollahs coming to power because he thought that was going to bring human rights. This is a guy that opposed the defense buildup of Ronald Reagan. He opposed the B-1. He opposed the B-2 that brought down … that policy direction brought down the Soviet Union. He opposed the MX missiles.”

“This is a country that right now kills about 13 million children through infanticide or abortion a year on their one child policy. They have about a million peaceful Muslims in prison camps up in the northwest for reeducation as good communists. They execute about 2400 of their people annually, a lot of them for dissidence.""

He went on to say that China, contrary to Biden, is “truly our number one potential adversary and our number one competitor in the world” and thinking otherwise is “beyond naïve.”

“This is a country that right now kills about 13 million children through infanticide or abortion a year on their one-child policy. They have about a million peaceful Muslims in prison camps up in the northwest for reeducation as good communists. They execute about 2400 of their people annually, a lot of them for dissidence,” Charles said.

“They have islands in the South China Sea that they built for disruption of international trade. They are pushing the limits on super computing to hack us. They have space weapons that they have tested.”

2175,"The Number Ones: Johnny Nash’s “I Can See Clearly Now”","In The Number Ones, I’m reviewing every single #1 single in the history of the Billboard Hot 100, starting with the chart’s beginning, in 1958, and working my way up into the present.   ***  Johnny Nash – “I Can See Clearly Now”  HIT #1: November 4, 1972  STAYED AT #1: 4 weeks  The ongoing conversation between American and Jamaican music has always been a fascinating thing. According to legend, the big bang for Jamaican music culture was the invention of the transistor radio, which allowed Jamaican listeners to hear the Fats Domino records that were being played on New Orleans R&amp;B stations. Jamaican musicians would try to play the New Orleans R&amp;B beat, and they couldn’t get it quite right. But their own chugging form of that beat became its own thing. It became ska, which begat rocksteady, which begat reggae.  That whole story is probably apocryphal. I have a hard time believing that this entire rich musical culture came out of these amazing musicians’ inability to play a pretty simple beat. But it does serve to highlight the ways that Jamaican music and black American music have been exchanging ideas back and forth for decades. I hear a ton of Sam Cooke and Otis Redding, for instance, in the voices of Jamaican singers like Jimmy Cliff. And I hear a ton of Jimmy Cliff in Johnny Nash, the American singer who lived in Jamaica for years and who helped introduce the world to Bob Marley.  I’ve seen “I Can See Clearly Now,” Nash’s one monster hit, described as the first reggae song ever to hit #1 in America. That’s wrong. “I Can See Clearly Now” isn’t a reggae song. It doesn’t have that big one-drop beat, and I think you need to have that to qualify as a reggae song. “I Can See Clearly Now” is informed by reggae, but then, so is the Staple Singers’ “I’ll Take You There,” a song built on the bones of an instrumental hit from Jamaica. Really, “I Can See Clearly Now” isn’t a song that belongs to any one musical tradition. Instead, it’s a lovely piece of the kind of alchemy that can only happen when the right writer pulls the right ideas from the right places.   Johnny Nash was 32 when he hit #1 with “I Can See Clearly Now,” and he’d already had 15 years in the game. Nash came from Houston, and he grew up singing in church. At 13, he started performing on Matinee, a music-themed TV show on the local station KPRC. At 17, he scored his first national hit, a fairly generic piece of orchestral-pop schmaltz called “A Very Special Love.” (It peaked at #23 on the pre-Hot 100 days of 1957.) It was years before Nash made another real hit, but he kept hanging around the margins, releasing singles and occasionally acting in movies like the 1959 anti-racism coming-of-age drama Take A Giant Step.  In 1965, Nash and Danny Sims, a New York restauranteur who he’d befriended, started a label called JODA Records, and they signed the Cowsills, a Rhode Island family band who scored a bunch of hits once they moved on to a bigger label. But 1965 is also when Sims and Nash moved to Jamaica. To hear Sims tell it, he’d been booking Malcolm X on the lecture circuit, and he was getting a little too much scrutiny from the FBI, so it was time to leave town. Sometime in the late ’60s, Nash heard a young Bob Marley singing at a Rastafarian celebration, and he and Sims signed Marley and his bandmates Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, hoping that the trio would write some songs for Nash.  Being around reggae worked wonders for Nash. In 1968, Nash recorded a reggae ballad called “Hold Me Tight,” and the song made it to #5 in the US. (It’s a 7.) And for a few years, Nash and Marley worked closely together. Marley wrote a bunch of songs for Nash, three of which ended up on the album that would become I Can See Clearly Now. (One of those songs was “Stir It Up,” which Marley had originally recorded in 1967. Nash’s version would become a hit, peaking at #12 in the US, and the version that Marley recorded in 1973 became one of his signature songs.)  But “I Can See Clearly Now” didn’t come from Marley or from any of the other reggae musicians in Nash’s orbit. Nash wrote and produced the song himself. He recorded it in London. It’s hard to find credits for the song online. Marley and the other Wailers played on some of the album tracks, but it seems like they weren’t on “I Can See Clearly Now.” Musicians from the Fabulous Five, Inc., a Jamaican session band, may have played on the song. But members of the Average White Band, the Scottish funk group who will eventually appear in this column, definitely appeared on it. (Bassist Alan Gorrie played on the song; he talked to the Houston Chronicle about it decades later. I’d love to know whether the studio band also included the two AWB guys who played on “My Ding-A-Ling,” the eternally shitty Chuck Berry song that “I Can See Clearly Now” replaced at #1.)  Maybe there’s a little bit of reggae in the drums on “I Can See Clearly Now” — the way they glide. But there’s other stuff, too. There’s some beautifully fuzzed-out guitar. There’s a lithe, supple bassline. There’s a massive sunburst of horns that rolls in halfway through. I think there’s an accordion? And above it all, there’s Nash, joyous and unconcerned.  There’s a dark but enduring theory that “I Can See Clearly Now” is a song about suicide, about giving yourself up to oblivion: “I think I can make it now, the pain is gone / All of the bad feelings have disappeared.” That’s not how Nash meant it, and I hope that’s not how too many people take it. Instead, it’s a song about pushing through struggle, through a shitty period. It’s about the euphoria that can come from that struggle, and from making it to the other side: The paycheck that gets you out of overdraft, the half-decent date that restores your faith in humanity. The song is vague and fuzzy and indistinct in its wording. But that’s where its power comes from, too. It’s a universal feeling, a moment of fleeting bliss that can change your whole outlook.  And it beautiful. Nash sells the song with an elegant simplicity. His voice hits high notes with an infectious ease. And maybe the float in Nash’s voice is where “I Can See Clearly Now” draws the most from reggae. There’s a grit to the song, but it’s not the sort of grit that comes to American pop music through gospel. It’s the sort of soaring ecstasy that implies that the singer has been through some shit. It’s the darkness that the light implies.  GRADE: 9/10  BONUS BEATS: Here’s Screeching Weasel’s snarl-whining punk cover of “I Can See Clearly Now,” from the 1991 album My Brain Hurts:   BONUS BONUS BEATS: The aforementioned reggae legend Jimmy Cliff covered “I Can See Clearly Now” for the soundtrack of the 1993 movie Cool Runnings. And that fizzy pop-reggae take on the song is, implausibly enough, Cliff’s highest-charting single in the US. (It peaked at #18.) Here’s the video:   BONUS BONUS BONUS BEATS: Here’s Soul Asylum’s cover of “I Can See Clearly Now,” recorded at a 1997 live show and released in 2004:   (Soul Asylum’s highest-charting song is 1993’s “Runaway Train,” which peaked at #5. It’s an 8.)  THE NUMBER TWOS: The Moody Blues’ stoned-romantic “Nights In White Satin,” a 1967 single reissued in 1972, peaked at #2 behind “I Can See Clearly Now.” It’s an 8.","__label__Positive"

309,"A Woman Deals with her OCD with Charm","Spas, rehab, and Starbucks are Margaret's life.
Walt is a widower with three daughters.  He tells me about his oldest, now nearly fifty, who has wandered the world for the last eight or nine years, while her life is controlled by the many difficulties of living with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), an anxiety disorder that produces uncontrollable, disturbing thoughts and behaviors that a person feels the need to repeat over and over. These behaviors or rituals give brief relief from the anxiety the thoughts cause.
Since about 2010 she has had no possessions nor any money except what I provide.  She lives on the streets, usually in Mediterranean countries.  She likes to have a membership at a fancy spa.  She makes friends with the staff and spends her days there, then walks around all night.  She’s good at getting people to help her or do what she wants.  She’ll ask to use their cell phones.  She’ll ask for food.  She’s an incredible negotiator.  She asks you to do something and you say no, and she gives you a reason you can’t argue with, and before you know it you’re doing what she wants. Even though she’s dealing with the terrible thoughts that OCD produces, there are times when she’s happy, even joyful.
Walt opens his tablet to show me photos of Margaret.  I see a a very skinny but muscular woman, grinning broadly at the camera, doing a pirouette in one snap, in another posing with another young woman who Walt explains was a friend from Starbucks.
Gifted , beautiful, very focused, a cheerleader, self-sufficient, valedictorian of her high school class.  She was a shooting star.  I think we neglected her because she seemed so capable of taking care of herself.
She graduated from MIT Phi Beta Kappa in physics. In graduate school she switched to business administration and earned an MBA so she could work in finance. First one job, then another, then another.  With her husband, who also worked in finance, she moved to Frankfurt.  We knew by that time that she had bulimia.  Her husband tried to do the right thing for several years. He asked me to take her to a program for eating disorders in the Midwest.  But it wasn’t her kind of place. Too rustic. Eventually he divorced her. She couldn’t get work and used up the funds she had invested.
For many years I didn’t think she had a mental illness.  I thought she was different.  I would tell people, “She’s doing things her way, she’s chosen a hard road.” My attitude was that we could talk our way out of problems. I was influenced by Thomas Szasz, a psychiatrist who believed that what we call mental illness is usually a problem in living, a coping strategy that isn’t working.  Maybe I still believe that.  I’m torn.
What’s her life like now?
I’ve been visiting her in Europe for years.  Maybe twelve times in the last fifteen years. When I’m visiting I spend many hours waiting for her to call my hotel room, or sitting in Starbucks killing time till she shows up. On one occasion I waited till 11 pm, when she came into Starbucks, walking a specific path through the store, moving quickly, saying nothing.  Then she was very conciliatory and friendly.  She got the Starbucks staff to wash their hands before they prepared her order, and to rearrange the tables to suit her.  She’s very persuasive.  It’s astounding.  She’ll get them to drive her around and help her out.
When we talk she controls the conversation with her fears and compulsions. If she hears a word related to sleep or cold, for instance, she has a ritual to allay her fears.  Once I yawned while talking with her.  She turned away, walked off and did yoga stretches to recover from the anxiety the yawn triggered.  Something as minor as a photo of her mother in a corduroy coat will freak her out because the coat isn’t washable.
She won’t handle cash because it’s not clean.  She depends on Starbucks where she can pay with a card.  She’ll spend $30 on a meal there: two or three soy lattes, each with an extra shot of espresso, plus a salad and a dessert.  She feels she has to have a new toothbrush and toothpaste and a new dress every day, usually a light dress with spaghetti straps, though she doesn’t like to wear clothes.  She charges everything and then tells me she has a huge credit card bill.  And I pay it.
At one point she found a treatment center in Spain that she wanted to attend and asked me to pay for her care there.  Their approach included psychiatric medication , group sessions and individual sessions.  When she left the campus to shop they wanted to send a nurse’s aide with her.  She managed to escape by an elaborate route that involved hitching a ride and going through a shopping area.   Actually, she escaped more than once, but finally she injured herself as she was returning.  She fell and ended up confined in a hospital. 
Eventually I consulted an OCD specialist from another rehab facility who offered involuntary commitment. They sent a team of good people with an ambulance to the hotel where she was staying.  After a long debate with her through her closed door, they went in.  She was naked, shrieking.  They gently talked her into going with them.  But she wouldn’t stay there.  She took a look around and left.  It didn’t meet her standards.  She appreciates quality.
It sounds to me like you’ve done a lot.
She’s so alone.  She’s become worse and worse. She’s mentioned suicide more than once. She knows she needs help but I think she fears making a change. You can consider change a kind of suicide, because you become someone else by killing part of who you are.
Recently she was jailed on a charge of trespassing.  She had sneaked into a hotel at night to swim in their pool.  (She’s good at sneaking into places.) I went to Spain for her trial, paid a fine and she was released.  Then she wouldn’t get in a cab, because it was dirty.  She talked someone into giving her a ride on a motorbike.
 The most recent crisis was terrible.  A security guard punched her when she was trespassing. Again I went to help her get medical care. A few months later she was charged with overstaying her visa, which she had done a number of times, and required to buy a ticket to the US and pay a fine.  Both of which I covered. Now she’s in San Diego. She joined a spa there but was kicked out. She’s been barred from several different spas.  She likes to walk around naked, or in a towel, and they don’t like that. I put $30 in her checking account, every day. I’m using money as a way to have some leverage.
Talking to you now, I feel anguish and guilt—the latter for not having made my daughter's situation my primary focus—particularly in these last five years since the death of my wife when I have had no other serious responsibilities.
What do you want for her?  I’m trying to get her to trust somebody enough to talk to them. A therapist, that is. It’s distressing that I have no means of connecting with her.  She has no phone.  I got her a water-resistant iPhone but she washed it too many times and it died. I don’t know how I’ll find her if I go to San Diego.","__label__Neutral"

387,"New York Amazon warehouse employees push to unionize","Workers in a recently opened Staten Island Amazon warehouse have announced their intention to unionize. The news comes at a less than ideal time for the retail giant, which is in the midst of opening one of two “HQ2” locations in nearby Long Island City, Queens.
The push also arrives as Amazon has faced increased scrutiny over the treatment of employees in its fulfillment centers. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders applied pressure against CEO Jeff Bezos, finally convincing the company to raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour.
In an interview with Bloomberg , employees complained about working conditions and compared their treatment to robots. The employees are hoping to leverage the massive incentives the city dangled in an attempt to woo the company during its prolonged competition for a second headquarters. All told, incentives total around $3 billion, a fact that has caused consternation among citizens and local officials who were uninvolved in the decision-making process.
“There’s never been greater leverage — if taxpayers are giving Amazon $3 billion, then taxpayers have the right to demand that Amazon stop being a union-busting company,” the president of Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union told the site. “It’s incumbent upon the governor and the mayor to make sure that nothing happens to these workers who are standing up for their rights. If Amazon continues its union-busting activities in New York, they should call off the deal.”
The Staten Island warehouse has only been open for a few months, but is a key part in the company’s push to make a second home in the greater New York City area. It’s one that is expected to eventually include $2.5 billion in spending and 25,000 hires.","__label__Neutral"
1999,"Avant-garde artist Yoshiko Chuma traverses disciplines, nations and causes","Having just returned to New York after performing in Venezuela, and still weary from the trip, choreographer, director and dancer Yoshiko Chuma breaks into a wry smile.

“If I had never left Japan and were able to hold my drink, I would probably have become an alcoholic,” she says. “I would probably be dead by now.”

Based in New York, Chuma, 68, is widely known for her avant-garde work. Since the 1980s, she has been pushing boundaries, creating controversial works that disrupt the fixed concepts and categories of the performing arts and cut deep through the mores of contemporary socio-political life.

Born into a medical family in Osaka in 1950, Chuma grew up in postwar Japan against the backdrop of rapid economic growth and political conflicts escalated by the Korean and Vietnam wars. Her first encounter with both dance and politics came in the early 1960s via her primary school teacher, the researcher and activist Kozo Tagawa. Tagawa taught modern dance to his pupils as an extra-curricular activity and himself participated in demonstrations against the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.

Chuma got involved in the anti-Vietnam movement when she entered university in Kanazawa. She frequented local cafes, which played a crucial role in activist networks at the time, and made trips to Tokyo, exploring radical bookshops and record stores. Yet, despite her growing interest in local grassroots activism, she felt frustrated that she had never been outside her native country and so began searching for a way to go abroad.

“I originally planned to travel to India as a backpacker,” she says. “But when my friend told me that many yogis and hermits lived along the Ganges River, I immediately changed my mind, because I knew that if I went there, I would never come back.”

When the writer-journalist Jugatsu Toi told Chuma about the artistic community in Soho, New York, including the abstract painter Kikuo Saito, who was close to artists such as Tom O’Horgan, Robert Wilson and Ellen Stuart, she made a snap decision to go there.

At the end of May, 1976, now in her mid 20s and with $3,000 in savings, Chuma left Japan for the first time, arriving in Hawaii at the height of the United States Bicentennial celebrations. The lone woman traveler was granted a generous six-month visa at Honolulu Airport.

“The clear blue sky seemed to stretch to infinity before my eyes,” she says recalling the excitement she felt when she stepped out the airport doors.

Once in Los Angeles and San Francisco, Chuma met many artists, including Hoki Tokuda, the last wife of Henry Miller. Her new acquaintances urged her to stay on the West Coast, rather than follow her desire to explore New York, where the downtown area beyond Avenue A had become so destitute and dangerous that taxi drivers would refuse to go there. Still, Chuma had to go.

Leaving behind sunny California for the jagged skyscrapers and murky streets of Manhattan, which was still reeling from the OPEC oil crisis, Chuma felt she had “fallen into a black hole, or some sort of chaos — a messy toy box, in which there was no border between the sane and the insane.” She saw men shouting and women crying in the graffiti-covered subways, and buildings demolished for the sake of insurance money.

Unable to speak English, Chuma also struggled with the language barrier. But it was her lack of English that first motivated her to explore communication using body language.

Living out of Saito’s loft for months and working as a cleaner and waitress, she began to make a name as a dancer-choreographer and collaborated with members of the famed Judson Dance Theater in Greenwich Village, including Simone Forti, Steve Paxton and Yvonne Rainer.

“Every single day, I met new people,” she recalls. “They were interested in me and helped me.”

When her visa due date approached, the dancer-choreographer Merce Cunningham offered to help extend her stay by filling out the necessary documents.

Having received little formal dance training, Chuma founded The School of Hard Knocks, an artistic collective named after the idiomatic phrase meaning to learn things the hard way, in 1982. Working by trial and error, she developed an approach to dance that centered on spontaneity. Within the next four decades, she transformed herself from a young emerging artist to an established leader, creating over 100 productions, many of which were difficult to categorize as dance.

Project after project, she questioned and disrupted conventional notions of dance, rarely setting out to make a formal dance piece, but channelling her desires and energy into creating something never before seen.

Traveling to more than 40 countries in Asia, America, East Europe and the Middle East, including Palestine and Afghanistan, she has worked with over 2,000 international and interdisciplinary collaborators, most of whom she met along her “Secret Journey” — the title of a recent series of projects for her ongoing mission.

Now, she continues to visit what she calls “trouble spots,” where she intentionally puts herself “in trouble,” she says, in order to challenge the preconceived myth of “danger” and encounter something beautiful beyond expectation.","__label__Neutral"
1985,"Lady Gaga Apologizes For Suggesting Zombie Boy Died By Suicide","Lady Gaga’s friend and muse Zombie Boy, real name Rick Genest, died last week at the age of 32. The Canadian artist and model fell from a fourth floor balcony. Genest’s family believes it was an accident, but others — including Lady Gaga — suggested suicide.

Gaga took to Twitter last Thursday to announce his death and talk about mental illness: “The suicide of friend Rick Genest, Zombie Boy is beyond devastating. We have to work harder to change the culture, bring Mental Health to the forefront and erase the stigma that we can’t talk about it. If you are suffering, call a friend or family today. We must save each other.”

Today, she posted another tweet apologizing for jumping to conclusions in her initial announcement: “Out of respect for Rick’s family, Rick &amp; his legacy I apologize if I spoke too soon as there was no witnesses or evidence to support any conclusion for the cause of his death. I in no way meant to draw an unjust conclusion My deepest condolences to his entire family and friends.”

In 2011, Genest appeared in Lady Gaga’s music video for “Born This Way,” which jump-started a high-profile modeling career. He also held the Guinness World Record for most insect tattoos. Before his death, he had reportedly been working on an album with ex-Rob Zombie guitarist Mike Riggs.

1391,"A ""Hey There Delilah"" TV Series Is Coming, So Good Luck Getting That Song Out Of Your Head","A ""Hey There Delilah"" TV Series Is Coming, So Good Luck Getting That Song Out Of Your Head
When I was was a teenager, the rule of thumb for was anything 20 years old was new again. The '90s had a '70s revival, the aughts had an '80s revival. That's held true somewhat this decade, the early 2010s saw the 90s come back into fashion. But now it seems things are already skipping ahead to bring stuff from the 2000s into vogue a few years ahead of schedule. The latest is the news of a ""Hey There Delilah"" TV series, based on the 2006-era indie earworm I spent six months desperately trying to drive out of my head.
Now, this is a show in the very early stages. It was announced this week in The Hollywood Reporter, but it's only in the ""developing a scripted series"" phase. Once they have a set of scripts, they'll start shopping it around to both production companies and networks to see if anyone wants to greenlight it to the pilot stage, and then see if a network will pick it up to air a season. Or better yet, they find a streaming service willing to give it a straight-to-series order and give it a nice big budget to do in-house.
For those who might have gotten the song out of your head at some point in 2007 and managed to forget it entirely, let me ruin the rest of your day by reminding you of its addictive crooning hook.
According to The Hollywood Reporter , which broke the news:
The Grammy- and Tony-nominated band is teaming with Lively McCabe Entertainment and Primary Wave to develop a scripted romantic dramedy based on its chart-topping single about a long-distance relationship. Producers, including the band's frontman and songwriter Tom Higgenson as well as writer Jeremy Desmon, will be in L.A. pitching the potential series — described as a contemporary fairy tale that expands the story within the song —  to multiple networks and studios this month.
Higgenson is credited with coming up with the idea of turning the story in his hit song into the basis for a TV series with Desmon, known for music based movies like Pump Up the Volume. Desmon will write the pilot script.
The Plain White Ts have been branching out from the touring and album circuit recently, with a Tony-nomination for their score for the Spongebob Squarepants musical. ""Hey There Delilah"" is still their biggest selling single to date, and has been used in TV shows from Orange Is the New Black to Family Guy, and even parodied on Sesame Street.
Higgenson is excited about the possibilities:
It’s been more than a decade since 'Hey There Delilah' was released, and people always ask me about it. A whole lot of people really connected with that song, and I’m very proud of that. I’m so excited to have an opportunity to give a new generation the chance to form their own connection with the song, and fall in love with its story through this new project.
If it gets picked up, ""Hey There Delilah"" will most likely not air until at least the 2019-2020 TV season.","__label__Neutral"

Police in Georgia arrested a man who was allegedly driving the vehicle that struck a 9-year-old girl who was playing in her yard.
The suspect, Gabriel Jabri Fordham, 28, faces multiple charges including hit and run, serious injury by vehicle and reckless driving, according to jail records in DeKalb County, Georgia. Fordham was arrested Tuesday.
The incident gained national attention after surveillance footage captured the incident last week. The video shows kids playing in their yard in a suburban neighborhood when a black car speeds down the street before hitting LaDerihanna Holmes, 9, and a friend.
The video later shows the driver and a passenger fleeing the scene while others try to help the girls.
“It was cold. It was very cold,” Charlette Bolton, LaDerihanna’s mother, said at a news conference. “I know they thought she was dead.”
In this video frame grab made available by attorney Chris Stewart, shows a speeding car out of control before it hits LaDerihanna Holmes, 9, as she plays in her front yard Friday, March 29, 2019 in Lithonia, Ga.
Fordham's attorney, Ryan Williams, told TV station WSB his client was trying to fight off a carjacker inside his car when the incident happened.
""Someone jumped in his vehicle with a pistol, put the gun to his face, made him drive, and the whole time my client was driving, he was kind of directing the path,"" Williams told WSB.
Police say LaDerihanna suffered multiple injuries including a skull fracture and a broken pelvis. Her friend, Alayshia Phillips, 11, sustained a foot injury.
A GoFundMe set up for the family has raised more than $47,000 to help with medical expenses.

“This is a huge step forward for teachers. It reverses the previous National Government’s decision to remove elected teachers from the Council, which undermined the profession, Chris Hipkins said.
“I originally introduced this Bill as a member’s bill because I, and members who now form the Government, believed the teaching profession could be trusted to elect representatives on their own professional organisation.
“It is only fair that teachers have their right of direct representation and election restored. It is disappointing that National have voted against this.
“However this Government recognises the importance of giving teachers the right to elect representatives to their own professional body, just like countless other professions.
The number of council members will be increased from nine to 13 – with seven members to be directly elected by the teaching profession and six members appointed by the Minister of Education. The new Council membership will be in place within a year.
“The name of the Council will also change to the Teaching Council of Aotearoa New Zealand, which better reflects the work of teachers, and the core business of the Council.
A number of amendments are made to ensure a smooth transition from the Education Council to the Teaching Council and to provide for ongoing arrangements for the Teaching Council.
“The changes implemented by the Bill are a part of the Government’s work to lift the status of the teaching profession,” Chris Hipkins said.

1432,"Report: Italy’s Communist Regime Conspired Against Trump and the American People","Leo Zagami | Infowars.com - May 31, 2019
Today, I would like to let the American people know that the rumors that the firing of top Italian spies are related to Obama and a plot to set up President Trump in the Hillary email scandal are 100% true. I can only say this now because I am finally safe in the United States of America after Matteo Renzi and Giorgio Napolitano, who continuously tried to have me arrested in the last few years.  It was these two criminals that ruined my life, and the life of my poor wife, who suffered anxiety after my involvement in the so-called “pitchfork” movement in Italy in 2013:
This sordid tale began with the involvement of Italian intelligence and Giorgio Napolitano, who served as the 11th President of the Republic from 2006 to 2015, and was the only Italian President to be re-elected to the presidency, due to the fact that he is the illegitimate son of Umberto II, the last King of Italy. For this reason, critics often refer to him as Re Giorgio (“King George”).
However,  Napolitano, who is a close friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton, was a member of the Italian Communist Party. Even the progressive newspaper, “The Guardian” that in recent years wrote many articles on the infamous Russiagate, and after his election in 2006 stated the following, “The Italian parliament today elected a former communist as president.” What people don’t know is that ex-president Giorgio Napolitano,  because of his bloodline, still controls Italian politics, even after he resigned in 2015.
In fact, former constitutional court judge and veteran center-left politician Sergio Mattarella, who took his place as Italian president, is only a modest Sicilian Mafia puppet in the hands of “King George” who actively conspired against Donald J. Trump with ex-Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in 2016 under direct orders from his friend, Hillary Clinton. Renzi, who abused Italian intelligence for similar illegal activities is linked to the Clinton Foundation and is currently participating to the Bilderberg meeting in Montreux Switzerland.
There could be, however, other interesting developments on this story that the Italian media are keeping totally silent because it involves SpyGate, linked to the total failure of the Russiagate investigation. We all know how they attempted to frame a young Trump staff assistant, George Papadopoulos, through a fake “Russian spy,” called professor Mifisud, and both these figures interestingly enough, revolved around the Link University in Rome, and contacts between the FBI, and other foreign agencies including the Italian ones that participated in a manipulative plot to sabotage President-elect Donald J. Trump.
All this is linked to the rather bizarre espionage story that surfaced in Italy two years ago regarding brother and sister, Giulio Occhionero (a Freemason of the Grand Orient of Italy), 45, and Francesca Maria Occhionero, 49. They were accused and arrested in January 2017 for illegally accessing classified information, and breaching and intercepting information technology systems and data communications. Thousands of emails which we all think are in the possession of the Italian Polizia Postale that actually originated from influential Italian figures like ex-PM Mario Monti,  Matteo Renzi, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, various generals, cardinals, and even myself, were stored on servers located in the U.S. and later investigated by the FBI cyber division.  The two ended up on trial in Italy and were convicted and then released, but everything quickly disappeared from the news, without analysis or comment, despite the macroscopic entity of the alleged piracy activity.
Recently, Giulio Occhionero, who I have met in the past in Masonic lodges while in Italy, openly accused the Italian intelligence services of having acted against Trump. Members of Italian intelligence and former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi were, in fact, approached by Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration back in 2016 in order to frame Trump after his election by planting Hillary’s classified emails on the American servers of Occhionero to force Trump to step down from office. I would like to finally confirm what Giulio Occhionero has been saying about Obama and the former leader of Italy, Matteo Renzi conspiring against Trump, but I also want to add that the real puppet master of the entire operation that fortunately failed, was Communist elitist and former Italian president Giorgio Napolitano, an enemy of the American people.
I could not write this if I was still living in Communist-controlled Italy, where these people tried to poison me, arrest me and even locked me up in a mental asylum in true Soviet fashion, to silence me after the failed Pitchfork protests of 2013.
Earlier this month, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte asked for the resignations of several top intelligence officials after his call with President Donald Trump, but it is not enough because the rigged Italian political and economic system makes it impossible for the populist government of Conte and Salvini to control anything as the non-elected Italian president Sergio Matterella is still controlled by George Soros and Pope Francis, who would like to get rid of Donald J. Trump at all costs. For this reason, I will stay in the U.S. for the time being, as I fear for my life and the safety of my family.
Interestingly enough, the recent filings made by Giulio Occhionero with the Procura of Perugia were filed with Gemma Miliani, the same Public prosecutor that initially investigated the unjust defamation lawsuit against me in Italy by two known Freemasons connected to the infamous P2 Lodge, that are using this case to have me arrested in Italy after I accused them of illegal activities connected to Italian intelligence and the Vatican.
I’ve taken Occhionero’s filing that has been recently translated by neonrevolt.com using software and included them, side-by-side so you can also see the name of Gemma Miliani that seems to be a Masonic asset of some kind who Occhionero should not trust.

749,"How To Deal With Skin Tags, According To Derms","There are certain things you should never ask the Internet — paramount among them is medical advice. Take the seemingly harmless query: What to do about a skin tag? Among the top results Google spits out are some seriously dubious DIYs (including one that involves cutting off your blood flow with dental floss). We get the logic: If skin tags are harmless (which any derm will tell you they are), why can’t we just remove them ourselves? Well, it turns out there are a host of reasons why you should leave even a simple snip to a pro. Below, three board-certified derms answer the web's three biggest skin tag questions — and set the record straight. What is a skin tag? “Skin tags are composed of skin that forms on a stalk,” explains Ava Shamban, MD, a dermatologist based in Beverly Hills. These growths often pop up along the neckline, under breasts, and near armpits. Though skin tags are harmless and extremely common, according to dermatologist Jessica Wu, MD, they can become irritated when rubbing against clothing or necklaces. Why do skin tags appear? The Internet is flooded with theories as to why skin tags pop up, including having had too much sun damage as a kid, poor circulation, or increased sun sensitivity from using too many skin-care actives (like alpha and beta hydroxy acids or retinoids). But our derms debunk these myths. As New York-based dermatologist Sejal Shah, MD, explains, we don’t exactly know why skin tags pop up. “One contributing factor may be friction between skin and clothing or adjacent areas of skin, which may explain why we often see them in skin folds. They are also more common in overweight or obese individuals,” she says, pointing to a study that correlates increased BMI with the growths. “Other associated or causative factors that have been proposed include family history, hormonal changes of pregnancy, and impaired glucose metabolism.” Furthermore, Dr. Shamban notes that hormonal changes (such as perimenopause) may, inexplicably, contribute to the formation of skin tags. But really, most of these are only theories. What’s the best way to remove a skin tag? Proposed home remedies for eradicating skin tags include repeatedly applying cotton soaked with iodine, tea tree oil, or apple cider vinegar. But Dr. Wu says these likely won’t work. As for the bevy of over-the-counter removal creams and kits, the derm is also wary. “I don’t recommend using a tag removal cream. I’ve seen horrible, discolored scarring and open wounds develop as a result,” Dr. Wu says. “An at-home liquid nitrogen freezing kit may help if the skin tags are small. But be careful and use them sparingly — freezing can leave marks on those with deeper skin tones.” So what is the right way to rid your body of these barnacles? Hit up a derm for their expertise. “If skin tags are narrow and tiny, I clip them off with sterile surgical scissors, which are very sharp and fine so they don’t traumatize the skin,” Dr. Wu says. “If they are larger and/or wide, I might use an electrical needle to zap the surface. This is less likely to scar if a patient has a deeper skin tone or if the tag is darker.” Knowing the above, it may be tempting to take a pair of shears to a skin tag yourself. But as Dr. Wu notes, “You’re taking your chances. Every so often a patient comes in with an infection or bleeding that won’t stop.” Also if the growth is dark, grows quickly, and/or bleeds, it’s important to have it checked by a derm, as it may be a suspicious mole disguised as a skin tag.","__label__Neutral"
1058,"Be prepared before heading to Naeba for Fuji Rock","With Fuji Rock happening this weekend, make sure you have everything you need to make the festival a comfy success. Here’s a checklist of essential items you should try to squeeze into your bags:
Footwear: You’re likely to need hiking boots if the weather remains dry or rain boots that are mid-calf or higher to keep all the mud out if the skies open up. Experienced festivalgoers usually add comfy insoles to give their feet extra protection.
Poncho or light raincoat: Go knowing one thing — it is sure to rain (as of publication, Typhoon Jongdari was expected to hit Naeba on Sunday). Umbrellas are prohibited.
Long-sleeved jacket: You can go through an entire night at Fuji Rock in just a T-shirt, but it’s best to be ready in case the temperature plummets.
Extra clothes: Sure, some people wash their clothes in the nearby river. If it rains, though, you’ll be happy you brought some extra socks.
Flashlight and spare batteries: It gets pretty dark after sunset, especially when looking for your tent.
Sunscreen, insect repellent, hat, sunglasses, folding fan: The Red Marquee and Cafe de Paris may have roofs, but you’re going to be exposed to the elements for pretty much the rest of the festival.
Towels: A small towel can help protect your neck from sunburn and wipe away any sweat or rain.
Toilet paper/tissues/wet wipes: Useful for mopping up spilled drinks and visiting the facilities.
Painkillers: There’s nothing worse than facing a day of ear-piercingly loud music with a splitting headache brought on by one too many drinks the previous evening.
Ear plugs: Speaking of loud music, these certainly help. They’re also handy in case the people around you decide to pull an all-nighter.
Small tarp or plastic bags: You’re definitely going to need to sit down throughout the day, so at least be sure to take a small tarp or even a plastic bag because logs, rocks and chairs can often get wet.
Cash: Recently there have been one or two emergency ATMs, but it would be better to bring cash with you.
Plastic bottles (and optional cover): You can’t bring glass bottles or cans into the festival grounds.
Toys: Your kids will thank you for it. Your sanity will, too.","__label__Neutral"

A Spotify logo in New York. December 11, 2013.   EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images
Spotify will step up its measures to crack down on ad blockers, according to the streaming platform's latest terms of services policy , as The Verge reports.
The new policy forbids “circumventing or blocking advertisements in the Spotify Service, or creating or distributing tools designed to block advertisements in the Spotify Service.” Users found in breach of the rules could have their accounts suspended or terminated. The updated policy kicks in on March 1.
Ad blockers are used by Spotify accounts who wish to listen to unlimited music without hearing commercials between songs (Spotify's premium version, a paid monthly service, does not contain ads).
Spotify's new terms are an escalation in the company's battle against ad blockers. 2% of all Spotify accounts utilize an ad blocker according to a March 2018 report , which led the company to begin monitoring and suspending accounts suspected of using the programs.
In January, an investigation by the BBC suggested that Spotify accounts all over the world had been compromised to juice streaming numbers for fake artists. Spotify said in a statement: ""We take the artificial manipulation of streaming activity on our service extremely seriously. Spotify has multiple detection measures in place monitoring consumption on the service to detect, investigate and deal with such activity.""","__label__Neutral"

The smoke-eater was one of roughly 400 firemen to be called down to the iconic Parisian cathedral on Monday after it went up in flames. Local officials told Reuters that he appears to be the only one who got hurt.
The firefighters managed to successfully stop the fire from spreading to Notre Dame’s two stone towers out in front, but were unable to save its spire. Most of the roof also appears to have burned.
“The fire is now weaker,” said Laurent Nunez, French secretary to the interior minister.
“We are now in a time of cooling but both towers of the cathedral are safe,” she told reporters. “We’re still working to save the cathedral’s work of arts.”

2773,"Gino Paoli, 60 anni di carriera e voglia di sperimentare: ""Le mie canzoni interrotte per dire solo essenziale""","A 84 anni e dopo 60 di carriera, avere ancora la voglia di sperimentare e rischiare. E' quello che fanno gli artisti. E' quello che ha fatto Gino Paoli con il nuovo doppio album, ""Appunti di un lungo viaggio"". Se il secondo cd contiene una rilettura ""jazzata"" di alcuni suoi grandi successi, il primo, ""Canzoni interrotte"", è un flusso di pensieri dove la forma canzone viene abbandonata. ""Ho voluto dire l'essenziale - spiega -, senza ripetizioni"". Niente rime, niente strutture classiche formate da strofe e ritornelli, nessuna ripetizione inutile. Nelle canzoni interrotte di Paoli la vita, l'amicizia, l'amore e persino la morte trovano spazio in un flusso cliclico, diviso secondo le quattro stagioni, che di fatto non ha un vero inizio e nemmeno una vera fine.  Poesie e pensieri messi in musica con gli arrangiamenti di Danilo Rea e il contributo della Roma Jazz String Orchestra. ""Un artista, se è un artista vero, deve andare oltre, oltre forme e i condizionamenti - spiega lui -. Ho pensato si potessero usare note e parole in forma diversa. Da una parte eliminando tutto ciò che è forma canzone obbligatoria, e dall'altra parte cercando l'essenzialità. Quando hai detto quello che dovevi dire a sufficienza basta, finisci lì. Mentre la canzone di solito è anche ripetizione"".  D'altro canto Paoli spiega che quella dell'essenzialità è stata una sua ricerca da sempre. ""Quando eravamo giovani io e Arnaldo Bagnasco abbiamo fondato un movimento che si chiamava “Essenzialismo” - ricorda -. Dove puoi dire una cosa in tre parole è inutile dirla in cinquanta. Certo, questo comporta il fatto di pensare prima di parlare, cosa che oggi non avviene molto spesso"". Nella scelta di dividere le composizioni di ""Canzoni interrotte"" secondo il succedersi delle stagioni, c'è un profondo legame che unisce vita e morte. ""Io non credo nella morte - spiega-. Se guardi la natura ti rendi conto che la morte non esiste. Esiste una stagione che finisce e ne comincia un'altra. il ciclo per cui ogni cosa ha una fine ma nella fine c'è un principio. Il giro delle stagioni mi dà molta serenità. L'unico rimpianto che ho è aver perso un sacco di gente che ora mi manca e con la quale avrei voluto passare più tempo"".  Tra questi c'è don Andrea Gallo, a cui è dedicata ""Due cani in chiesa"", frammento della ""Primavera"". ""Don Gallo era un uomo straordinario - ricorda il cantautore -, era contro tutto e con tutto. Ho fatto un film con lui, giravamo per la città, lo salutavano tutti, papponi, mignotte, disperati. E tutti gli davano appuntamento in chiesa. A un certo punto aveva i polmoni completamente cotti dal tumore e dato che non riusciva a dormire sdraiato si faceva portare in giro in macchina per riposare seduto. Sono stato io a farlo ricoverare quando era agli sgoccioli. Sono andato a trovarlo e mi ha detto: 'Mi hai fatto un bello scherzo, guarda dove sono finito'"". Il legame profondo con un uomo di chiesa e l'avanzare degli anni non hanno però cambiato l'atteggiamento di Paoli nei confronti della dimensione spirituale. ""Per me vale sempre il motto dell'anarchia: Né Dio né padroni. Non ho nessuna fascinazione per figure ultraterrene"". In un altro pezzo, 'Voglio morire malato', c'è tutto lo spirito ribelle di Paoli: ""Voglio morire malato perché voglio fare tutto. Che gusto c'è a morire sano se questo ha significato rinunciare a questo o a quello?"".  Nel secondo cd, tra ""Sapore di sale"", ""La gatta"", ""Il cielo in una stanza"" e ""Una lunga storia d'amore"", tutte rilette con grandi jazzisti come Rita Marcotulli, Ares Tavolazzi e Alfredo Golino, trova posto un unico pezzo di un altro cantautore, ""Ritornerai"", di Bruno Lauzi. ""Sono anni che faccio canzoni per ricordare degli amici. Luigi Tenco, Umberto Bindi e Fabrizio De André - spiega Paoli -. Bruno è la persona che mi manca di più, anche se era la persona più distante da me. Litigavamo sempre ma eravamo legatissimi, l'ho voluto con me in questo progetto"".  ""Appunti di un lungo viaggio"" arriva a 10 anni da ""Storie"", l'ultimo lavoro di canzoni inedite realizzato dal cantautore. ""Per ogni canzone che scrivo ce ne sono quattro che butto via - spiega -. Mio padre diceva 'quando non hai niente da dire stai zitto', e ho sempre seguito questa massima. Al punto che ci sono stati anni in cui non dicevo niente, mi ero quasi ritirato a vita privata"". Paoli qualcosa da dire ce l'ha in questi giorni. Sulla musica e il suo valore sociale per esempio, lui che si è spesso impegnato, anche direttamente a livello politico e si è sempre speso per temi importanti. ""L'artista dovrebbe dire la sua ma dovrebbe dirla alla sua maniera, non può fare della retorica - considera -. Certo oggi molti non lo fanno ma il poco impegno è figlio della delusione, la delusione ti porta al disinteresse"". Nel 1988 scrisse una canzone contro il razzismo, ""Hey Ma"", tema che a 30 anni di distanza sembra più attuale che mai. ""La situazione la vedo come allora ma peggiorata - spiega -. Quella canzone era nata a Ischia, dove la figlia di una mia collaboratrice, honduregna e di colore, era insultata in piscina da un ragazzino. 'Tu brutta negra in acqua non entri"" le aveva detto. E io sono tornato a casa e ho scritto 'Hey Ma'. Ho capito che se uno ragiona così è perché non gli hanno fatto capire sin da piccolo che il razzismo è una stronzata e gli uomini sono tutti uguali"".  Adesso Paoli sarà impegnato in tre eventi speciali: il 12 maggio all’Auditorium parco della Musica di Roma, il 13 luglio all’Umbria Jazz di Perugia e il 18 luglio nella sua Genova per un concerto ai Parchi di Nervi. A 84 anni l'intenzione di fermarsi non c'è. Perché, come spiega, ""il palcoscenico è una droga, non lo abbandoneresti mai. È finzione ma mentre fingi sei più vero di sempre"".","__label__Neutral"

973,"The Best Comfortable Summer Shoes to Wear to Work","It’s summer—meaning that people go to work but always want to leave. (There is a great outdoors outside of those skyscraper buildings!) Here at Vogue, footwear plays a big part in this carefree hot-weather attitude. One does not want to be confined to a cubicle, constrained in stuffy, dark-hued, teetering pumps. (Call them foot anvils!) For those with less laissez-faire dress codes, though, it isn’t always permissible to strut into an office wearing a pair of casual-but-chic rubber Havaianas sandals .

How to find the happy medium? Look to Vogue staffers, who all have very different opinions on comfortable and stylish summer shoes. Block heels in sandal form seem to be the most popular by far. (They are sturdy and walkable, according to several colleagues.) Other pieces to consider include mules, both pointed-toeand open-toe, as well as loafers and the elevated sneaker. Still want to bring the ugly shoe trend into the workplace? Take a note from Vogue Fashion News and Emerging Platforms Editor Steff Yotka and Vogue Fashion Director Virginia Smith, who both favor clunky flat slides in fun, bold prints. Now, back to work—but first, a roundup of the best summer footwear from those who study it closely.

It will be hard to beat my beloved Rick Owens Birkenstocks from last season, but these Dries Van Noten sandals may have a fighting chance…. They’re a far cry from my typical neutrals, but I was so taken with the plaid that I bought the matching pants!

I have really big feet, so finding shoes is always a struggle. When I find a pair that works, I tend to buy in multiples. Maryam Nassir Zadeh’s strappy sandals are pretty much a no-brainer for me. The midi-heel is super comfortable and the ankle strap is great for support—I can walk all day in these, no problem. Plus, they’re simple and polished enough to wear for work and just about any occasion. This style is one of her signatures, so I’ve managed to snag them in a few colors over the years.

Not that this is news to anyone, but Chloé shoes are consistently good, season after season. I have been making choice selections from each collection for years—long before the ubiquitous Susanna boot was ripped off by every major fast-fashion retailer (mine are currently in a dust bag, awaiting the day they can resurface in anonymity). My latest obsession is Spring's croc-effect sandals. There are a variety of styles: a chunky platform, an oversized buckle slide, a crisscrossed ankle-strap flat with toe loop. But they all hold the same appeal for everyday workwear: They’re low enough to be comfortable, but they skirt the line between utilitarian and high design, which makes them perfect for a cropped jean or an easy office dress. Also: Select styles are currently on sale, so that’s a huge plus.

I recently bought these minimal loafers from The Row in a dark brown and white and plan on rotating between the two all summer. Not only are they super comfortable, they make me feel polished for the office, even with a pair of jeans.

Sneakers are my favorite year-round, but I find them especially appealing during summer months, when all I want to do is walk outside in a dress. I pair my Nike Air Max 720s with a flowy Ganni number for work.

These little Prada sandals are perfect with a summer frock—and just as nice with denim and a crisp white button-down. Prepare to see me in these multiple times a week!

I keep a ton of shoes under my desk at work, but during the summer, there's nothing easier than slipping on one of these slides. Both seriously comfortable and not that high—I swear!

I love these striped raffia sandals from Ocelot Market; they go from beach to cubicle and back again.

Sophie Kemp, Vogue editorial assistantLet me be honest for second: I am pretty short and have no hand-eye coordination. (What can I say, I fell out of a lot of trees as a kid.) This basically means traditional heels aren't really an option for me, unless I'm jonesing to wipe out on my walk to my above-ground subway stop in the morning. To get a little height in the warmer months, I stick to clogs. They're a lot easier to walk in for me, and they give me the aura of a gardener or an extra in The Sound of Music. My go-to pair for work is a pair of sky-high clogs by Rachel Comey, in wood and black leather. Surprisingly comfortable and extremely walkable, these were a great purchase. I'm looking forward to wearing them without socks and sporting them while walking around lower Manhattan on my lunch break en route to get some iced tea.

Share &lt; br /&gt;this article:

Although complex and rewarding in its own right, the music Gabrielle Smith made as Eskimeaux and Ó did not prepare me for the grand scope of her Gabby’s World material. Smith’s first single under the new guise, “ Rear View ,” burst from the speakers with a rare vibrance. It was an ornate little symphony of a pop song — so many sounds swirling around Smith’s delicate diction, all of them brimming with life. I loved it immediately.

Now comes “Winter, Withdraw,” the opening track from the new album Beast On Beast, and I love this one too. It’s a bit less immediate than “Rear View,” opening with just Smith and some minimal chords — “At the black center of my thoughts, I plead / “Winter, withdraw” / And I decide / I boldly no longer feel the deep cold” — but over the course of several surprising turns, it works its way into a full-bodied rock epic. Or as Smith put it on Twitter , “It’s a gargantuan rock opera with a big huge finale that is probably my favorite moment we’ve had as a band.” By the end, power chords are raining down and symphonic strings are soaring across the sky.

What I’m saying is Gabby’s World is a place I quite enjoy visiting, and maybe you will too. Try it out below.

Figure skater Yuzuru Hanyu poses in front of the design of a new monument of him (right) in Sendai on Saturday. | KYODO
SENDAI - Reigning Olympic and former world champion Yuzuru Hanyu delighted fans on Saturday by taking part in a ceremony in his hometown of Sendai to unveil the design of a new monument celebrating the superstar figure skater.
Six hundred lucky lottery winners picked from among some 20,000 applicants were permitted inside the venue and got a glimpse of the 24-year-old, who appeared in a suit and tie instead of his familiar rock star-style skating costume.
The 2.3-meter tall, 1.6-meter wide monument depicting his trademark “Seimei” pose performed at the 2018 Olympics will be located near the south exit of Kokusai Center Station on the Sendai municipal subway Tozai Line next to another commemorating his 2014 Olympic title. The unveiling ceremony is scheduled for April 29.
“It’s (a) big deal that (my achievements) will remain as a part of history in physical form. I take pride in my back-to-back Olympic titles,” said Hanyu, who became the first man in 66 years to repeat as Olympic champion in February last year.
“It would bring me joy to see more children start figure skating,” he said.
Goshikinuma Pond, which is said to be the birthplace of figure skating in Japan, is a five-minute walk from the station.
In April 2017, a pair of monuments celebrating the achievements of two Olympic figure skating champions from Sendai — Hanyu and Shizuka Arakawa — was installed at the same station. The new work will be added alongside the existing ones.
Hanyu won back-to-back gold medals at the Winter Olympics, the first in Sochi in 2014 and the second last year in Pyeongchang.
In addition to winning two world championships, he also won four consecutive Grand Prix Final titles in the past.
He is a major celebrity off the ice as well, with hordes of international fans and Japanese media following his every move. He became the youngest individual recipient of the government’s People’s Honor Award last summer.
Currently, he resides in Canada where he trains under Brian Orser.","__label__Neutral"

More rain is predicted overnight in North Otago, the Canterbury region and Nelson ranges.

The Taieri and Clutha rivers remain flooded, but are slowly receding, said Otago Regional Council director of engineering, hazards and science Gavin Palmer.

The flooded rivers continue to cut off residents in the settlement of Henley, near Dunedin.

Rainfall, combined with melting snow and saturated ground, has seen the Kakanui, Kauru, Waianakarua and Shag rivers in North Otago rise.

""So at the moment the Otago Regional Council is just monitoring the situation - we think the flows in those North Otago rivers will get close to something we had earlier in the week, maybe a little less,"" Dr Palmer said.

Canterbury Regional Council has issued a flood warning and is advising farmers living near the Pareora River to move stock to higher ground.

More than 70mm of rain has already fallen in the Pareora catchment, south of Timaru.

Heavy rain warnings are also in place for Rotorua and the Bay of Plenty in the North Island.","__label__Neutral"

440,"Chickenpox parties and natural immunity: Your questions answered - CNN","Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez is a practicing pediatrician and a Stanford and CNN Global Health and Media Fellow.
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin recently said he chose to expose all nine of his children to the chickenpox instead of giving them the vaccine.
""They had it as children. They were miserable for a few days, and they all turned out fine,"" Bevin said in an interview with WKCT, a Bowling Green, Kentucky, radio station.
So-called chickenpox parties, in which parents expose their kids to the disease based on the belief that it will be more serious if contracted as an adult, are not a new concept. Before vaccines became available, the parties used to be very popular for diseases such as chickenpox or measles.
Although these parties are far less common now, parents will still occasionally advertise having a child with chickenpox at home, inviting other parents with small children to come ""get it over it and develop lifelong immunity.""
Are chickenpox parties a good idea?
No, they really are not a good idea at all.
Chickenpox parties were an OK idea in the days when parents had no other way to build long-lasting immunity in their children. But since the introduction of the chickenpox vaccine in 1995, parents no longer need to go to these extremes. They have a much safer way to make sure their kids are protected for years to come.
Two doses of the vaccine, given at ages 12 months through 15 months and then again at 4 through 6 years, are about 90% effective at preventing chickenpox.
In the small number of people who still get chickenpox despite having received the vaccine, the illness is usually milder, with fewer or no blisters and a mild fever, or sometimes no fever at all, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Developing immunity to an infectious disease like the chickenpox means the immune system has seen the virus, has mounted a response, and has developed what's called ""memory"" to the particular illness. This immune system memory will allow it to react faster the next time it encounters a virus like the chickenpox, protecting the person against the infection.
The immune system does not care how the body was exposed to the illness. Whether this happened through one full blown infection such as that acquired at a chickenpox party, or after several doses of a vaccine, immunity is immunity.
In the long run, the difference comes in days feeling ""miserable,"" like Bevin admitted his children felt; in days missed from school and work; and in the small but very real number of severe and potentially fatal complications that come from acquiring an illness like the chickenpox.
Many of us did. Again, our parents had no better way to protect us against the chickenpox, and it is true that the illness can be more severe in adulthood.
But although many still think of the chickenpox as a mild, no-big-deal childhood illness, the truth is that this very contagious infectious disease can go beyond the rash, itchiness and fever.
Before the vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995, chickenpox used to affect 4 million people every year. Among those, 8,000 to 18,000 were hospitalized, and 100 to 150 died every year. In 2017, the number of total cases was down to 8,775, according to the CDC .

Chickenpox can be more serious in pregnant women and children under age 1. The vaccine is not indicated for either of these groups, hence the importance of everyone else being vaccinated and stopping the spread of this illness.
The CDC also explains that complications from the chickenpox include bacterial superinfections of the skin, blisters, pneumonia, and extension of the infection to the central nervous system -- in addition to hospitalization and death.
Can you get shingles if you had the chickenpox vaccine?
Shingles vaccine side effects mostly mild, yet 3% of complaints were serious, CDC says
The short answer to the shingles question is this: All evidence so far indicates that those who receive the chickenpox vaccine have a lower risk of developing shingles later in life than those who had the chickenpox itself.
Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a skin disorder triggered by the chickenpox or varicella virus. It can remain dormant along nerve roots after someone gets the chickenpox and reactivate later in life.
Vaccination against shingles is recommended for all adults 50 and older in the United States.","__label__Neutral"
1448,"""Bad Dog?"" The Psychology of Using Positive Reinforcement","A new study shows a human's emotional state and confidence are important.

""My dog Joey was badly abused by other dogs and humans when he was young and learned that he had to fight back. He was doing what came naturally. Now that I've worked hard to socialize him to other dogs and to humans and to praise him when he doesn't fight back, he's learned that fighting fire with fire doesn't work. I always told him he's a 'good dog' when he didn't fight back.""

""I learned that letting Henry know he was a 'good dog' when he wasn't reactive was the best way to teach him that fighting back wasn't the best strategy to use. I learned that positive training was the only way to go.""

A new essay by Psychology Today writer Dr. Zazie Todd called "" Confidence and Emotions Affect People's Use of Positive Reinforcement to Train Reactive Dogs "" crossed my computer screen a few hours ago. I immediately read her piece and the research essay on which it was based published in the journal Risk Analysis by University of Bristol (UK) researchers Drs. Emma Williams and Emily Blackwell titled "" Managing the Risk of Aggressive Dog Behavior: Investigating the Influence of Owner Threat and Efficacy Perceptions .""

Dr. Todd's essay is available for free online, however, while the original study is not, I was able to read it and I'm glad I did. It's a significant contribution to available literature on different methods used to train aggressive/reactive dogs, and clearly shows that positive reinforcement, force-free training, is the way to go. (See "" Science Shows Positive Reward-Based Dog Training is Best ,"" "" Should Dogs Be Shocked, Choked, or Pronged? "" and "" Training Methods Affect the Service Dog–Veteran Relationship ."") The first three quotations with which I began this essay are just a handful of many in which a human called or often screamed ""bad dog"" when the dog was simply doing something that was entirely dog appropriate and appropriate to the situations in which they behaved aggressively. It's the way in which some dogs learned to respond to past situations in which they felt scared and unsafe either because it was instinctive and/or because it worked. The last two quotations are right on the mark. Joey, the dog, had to unlearn what had worked for him in the past, before he found a loving and safe home and was given plenty of opportunities to interact with other dogs, all of whom would have nothing to do with him when he did what came naturally to him. Henry's human also learned that using positive training and letting him know he was a ""good dog"" when he wasn't reactive really worked. 

The abstract for Drs. Williams and Blackwell's study reads: ""Aggressive behavior in pet dogs is a serious problem for dog owners across the globe, with bite injuries representing a serious risk to both people and other dogs. The effective management of aggressive behavior in dogs represents a challenging and controversial issue. Although positive reinforcement training methods are now considered to be the most effective and humane technique to manage the risk of aggression , punishment ‐based methods continue to be used. Unfortunately, there has been little scientific study into the various factors influencing whether dog owners choose to use positive reinforcement techniques to manage aggression in their dogs.""

To remedy the lack of data, Drs. Williams and Blackwell used surveys completed by 630 people whose dogs showed reactive behavior, including barking, lunging, and growling, the most common behaviors, and also snapping, snarling, nipping, and biting. The people also were asked if they knew about positive reinforcement training (93% had), and 67% reported they knew basic aspects of dog behavior. The surveys were based on protection motivation theory (PMT), a theory put forth in 1975 by psychologist Ronald W. Rogers ""to investigate the factors that influence owner use of positive reinforcement methods to manage aggressive behavior, in an attempt to understand potential barriers and drivers of use. In addition, the article provides an initial exploration of the potential role of wider psychological factors, including owner emotional state, social influence, and cognitive bias ."" PMT focuses ""on how owner perceptions of threat related to the likelihood and severity of aggressive behavior, and perceptions of efficacy related to the effectiveness and personal use of positive reinforcement as a risk management strategy, influence both future intentions and current use of such training techniques."" To the best of their knowledge, PMT has not previously been applied the study of human-animal interactions. 

"" It is important for owners , and the practitioners helping them, to consider their own wellbeing and reactions as well as those of the dog. In particular, how this may influence the choices that they make and in turn, how their own responses can best be managed over the course of their training journey.""

"" The findings of this research suggest a number of practical implications applicable to practitioners working with the owners of dogs who display aggressive behavior . First, it is encouraging to note that even though trainers and some TV celebrities still expound the virtues of punishment-based training methods, this was highlighted as less important in the list of potential influences.""

Dr. Todd nicely summarizes the results of this landmark study, one that has clear practical applications. She writes, ""New research from Dr. Emma Williams and Dr. Emily Blackwell (University of Bristol) looks at the factors that affect people’s decisions about the dog training methods to use with their reactive dog. The study shows the importance of dog trainers building their clients’ confidence and abilities to use positive reinforcement has important implications for how dog trainers work with their clients."" She quotes an email from Dr. Williams in which she wrote: ""When learning to use positive methods, people are likely to need practical support that demonstrates the effectiveness of reward-based training and also provides an opportunity to practice under expert guidance, so that people feel truly confident in using the techniques themselves in a range of challenging scenarios. This study shows the emotional impact that attempting to manage a reactive dog can have. It is important for owners, and the practitioners helping them, to consider their own wellbeing and reactions as well as those of the dog. In particular, how this may influence the choices that they make and in turn, how their own responses can best be managed over the course of their training journey."" The researchers conclude, ""the results suggest that increased perceptions of the potential severity of aggressive behavior in dogs may increase the likelihood that individuals will use positive-reinforcement methods.""

"" Future interventions should focus on enhancing owner confidence in the effective use of positive reinforcement techniques across multiple scenarios, as well as helping owners manage their own emotional responses when they encounter challenging situations and setbacks.""

Drs. Williams and Blackwell are well aware that more research is needed on the reasons why people choose to use different training techniques. However, their data clearly show that the emotional state and confidence of dog guardians plays a strong role in how they choose to deal with a reactive dog. In her summary of Drs. Williams and Blackwells' seminal study Dr. Todd writes, ""This is an important study that helps us understand how people make decisions about dog training. The survey shows that when someone has a reactive dog, their future use of positive reinforcement to deal with the behaviour problem is predicted by their confidence in using it at home and in public and their beliefs in its effectiveness. Negative emotions and bad experiences reduce people’s confidence in using positive reinforcement."" I agree. She goes on, ""This means that providing support to build people’s confidence and prevent negative situations (or coach coping strategies for them) will likely increase the uptake of positive reinforcement methods. The people side of dog training cannot be neglected if trainers are to encourage people to use positive reinforcement."" (My emphasis)

In the title to my essay I put the phrase ""bad dog"" in quotes because it has to be emphasized that calling a dog a ""bad dog"" often indicates a lack of knowledge about dog behavior and can backfire when a person is trying to stop a dog from doing something. Sometimes a dog will behave aggressively because it's the dog appropriate thing to do, or at least it has worked for them in the past when they felt threatened or insecure. It's also essential to pay careful attention to each and every individual dog because they aren't all the same. Their unique personalities may come to the fore and they take action when things get iffy or tough. (See  Canine Confidential: Why Dogs Do What They Do and  Unleashing Your Dog: A Field Guide to Giving Your Canine Companion the Best Life Possible.)  This is among the many reasons why it's essential that people become fluent in dog, or dog literate. Along these lines, it's encouraging that two-thirds of the people who partook in Drs. Williams and Blackwells' study said they had basic knowledge of dog behavior. Concerning reactive dogs, for example, when a dog growls, it's not necessarily being assertive or aggressive. Growling isn't as simple as it seems, and sometimes it's entirely appropriate to the situation at hand. (See "" Why Dogs Growl. "") In many situations with which I'm familiar, calling a dog a ""bad dog"" is way too fast for me. 

Dr. Todd ends her essay by writing, ""If you have a reactive dog, choose a dog trainer with care as dog training is not licensed. You will also find a useful resource at the Care for Reactive Dogs website.  ."" Her cautionary statement is very important because globally there are very few if any regulations on who can call themselves a dog trainer. (See "" Choose a Dog Trainer as Carefully as You Would a Surgeon "" and "" Dog Training's Dirty Little Secret: Anyone Can Legally Do It ."") 

Stay tuned for further studies on the reasons why people choose different methods of training. Drs. Williams and Blackwells' study is just what is needed in an area in which there are few systematic quantitative studies. I hope their entire essay becomes available online sooner than later. It is that significant and should be required reading for all dog trainers/teachers. I also hope that people who decide to share their homes and hearts with a canine companion will at least read summaries of their results. I find it extremely interesting and important that a human's emotional state can play such a strong role in how they decide to train their dog. It's also essential to pay careful attention not only to the behavior of a dog but also to the nature of their relationship with their humans. Drs. Williams and Blackwells' findings are consistent with the fact that dogs read us well. (See "" Dogs Watch Us Carefully and Read Our Faces Very Well "" and "" Dogs mirror stress levels of owners, researchers find ."") 

When we know more about dog behavior and dog-human relationships, perhaps especially in situations where reactive dogs do what seems to serve them best, namely, growl, snap, snarl, nip, or bite for whatever reasons, it'll be a win-win for all. I also hope that positive reinforcement training will prevail in these and all other situations where a dog needs to learn to be more social and less reactive and unlearn what might have worked for them in the past. The quotations from Joey and Henry's loving humans with which I began this essay are right on the mark. Fighting fire with fire doesn't work, and saying ""good dog"" or letting your dog know they're a ""good dog"" go a long way in helping them to learn what works and what doesn't. (See "" For Dogs, Helicopter Humans Don't Balance Scolds and Praise ."") Don't hesitate to sprinkle your dog with praise. It's not only good for them, but also good for you.","__label__Neutral"
2243,"Looking back at Google+","Google+ is shutting down at last. Google announced today it’s sunsetting its consumer-facing social network due to lack of user and developer adoption, low usage and engagement. Oh, and a data leak . It even revealed how poorly the network is performing, noting that 90 percent of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds long. Yikes.

But things weren’t always like this. Google+ was once heralded as a serious attempt to topple Facebook’s stranglehold on social networking, and was even met with excitement in its first days.

The company originally revealed  its new idea for social networking in June 2011. It wasn’t Google’s first foray into social, however. Google had made numerous attempts to offer a social networking service of some sort, with Orkut , launched in 2004 and shuttered in fall 2014; Google Friend Connect in 2008 (retired in 2012); and Google Buzz in 2010 (it closed the next year).

But Google+ was the most significant attempt the company had made, proclaiming at the time: “we believe online sharing is broken.”

The once top-secret project was the subject of several leaks ahead of its launch , allowing consumer interest in the project to build.

Led by Vic Gundotra and Bradley Horowitz, Google’s big idea to fix social was to get users to create groups of contacts — called “Circles” — in order to have more control over social sharing. That is, there are things that are appropriate for sharing with family or close friends, and other things that make more sense to share with co-workers, classmates or those who share a similar interest — like biking or cooking, for example.

But getting users to create groups is difficult because the process can be tedious. Google, instead, cleverly designed a user interface that made organizing contacts feel simpler — even fun, some argued . It also was better than the system for contact organization that Facebook was offering at the time.

Next thing you know, everyone was setting up their Circles by dragging-and-dropping little profile icons into these groups, and posting updates and photos to their newly created micro-networks.

Another key feature, “Sparks,” helped users find news and content related to a user’s particular interests. This way, Google could understand what people liked and wanted to track, without having an established base of topical pages for users to “Like,” as on Facebook. But it also paved the way for a new type of search. Instead of just returning a list of blue links, a search on Google+ could return people’s profiles who were relevant to the topic at hand, matching pages and other content.

Google+ also introduced Hangouts, a way to video chat with up to 10 people in one of your Circles at once.

At the time, the implementation was described as almost magical.  This was due to a number of innovative features, like the way the software focused in on the person talking, for example, and the way everyone could share content within a chat.

Within two weeks, it seemed Google had a hit on its hands, as the network had reached 10 million users . Just over a month after launch, it had grown to 25 million . By October 2011, it reached 40 million . And by year-end, 90 million . Even if Google was only tracking sign-up numbers, it still appeared like a massive threat to Facebook.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s first comment about Google+ , however, smartly pointed out that any Facebook competitor will have to build up a social graph to be relevant. Facebook, which had 750 million users at the time, had already done this. Google+ was getting the sign-ups, but whether users would remain active over time was still in question.

There also were early signs that Google+’s embrace of non-friends could be challenging. It had to roll out blocking mechanisms months after launch, as the network became too spammy with unwanted notifications. Over the years that followed, its inability to control the spam became a major issue .

Even as late at 2017, people were still complaining that spam made Google+ unusable.

In an effort to compete with Facebook, Google+ also enforced a “real names” policy. This angered many users who wanted to use pseudonyms or nicknames, especially when Google began deleting their accounts for non-compliance. This was a larger issue than merely losing social networking access, because losing a Google account meant losing Gmail, Documents, Calendar and access to other Google products, too.

The company also flubbed its handling of brands’ pages , banning all Google business profiles in an ill-conceived fashion — something it later  admitted was a mistake.

It wouldn’t fix some of these problems for years, in fact.  Eric Schmidt  even reportedly once suggested  finding another social network  if you didn’t want to use your real name — a comment that came across as condescending.

Google+ came to Google Search in August. The company announced Google+ posts would begin appearing in “social search” results that showed when users were signed in. Google called this new toggle “search plus your world .” But its slice of “your world” was pretty limited, as it couldn’t see into the posts shared among your friends and followers on Facebook and Twitter.

If you can’t beat ’em, force ’em! Google began to require users to have a Google+ account in order to sign up for Gmail. It was not a user-friendly change , and was the start of a number of forced integrations to come.

TechCrunch’s Devin Coldewey argued that Google failed to play the long game in social, and was too ambitious in its attempt with Google+. All the network really should have started with was its “+1” button — the clicks would generate piles of data tied to users that could then be searchable, private by default and shareable elsewhere.

Spam remained an issue on Google+. This time, event spam had emerged, thanks to all the nifty integrations between Google+ and mission-critical products like Calendar.

Users were not thrilled that other people were able to “invite” them to events, and these automatically showed up on your Calendar — even if you had not yet confirmed that you would be attending. It made using Google+ feel like a big mistake.

The following year after Google+’s launch, there was already a lot of activity around Hangouts — which interestingly, has since become one of the big products that will outlive its original Google+ home.

Video was a tough space to get right — which is why businesses like Skype were still thriving. And while Hangouts were designed for friends and family to use in Google+, Google was already seeing companies adopt the technology for meetings, and brands like the NBA for connecting with fans.

The focus on user interests in Google+ also continued to evolve this year with the launch of Communities — a way for people to set up topic-based forums on the site. The move was made in hopes of attracting more consumer interest, as growth had slowed.

Google+  wasn’t working out as a “Facebook killer.” Engagement was low, distribution was mixed and it seemed it was only being used by tech early adopters, not the mainstream. So the new plan was to double down on Google+ not being a destination website, like Facebook, but rather make it a social layer across Google products .

It had already integrated Google+ with Gmail and Google Contacts , shortly after its launch. In June 2013, it offered a way for people to follow brands’ pages in Gmail.","__label__Neutral"
2199,"A New American Brand Is Building a Vintage-Inspired Chronograph Watch","It’s always fun to discover new, home-grown American microbrand watches with a local theme. Based in the American Midwest, Haven is one such brand, launching with a chronograph watch called the Chilton that brings together a host of features vintage watch fans tend to appreciate. Swiss movement and “box-style” sapphire crystal? Check and check. Panda dial-version? Check. Reverse panda dial-version? Check. And the vintage inspiration continues in just about every detail.

The Haven Chilton takes cues from across the world of vintage chronograph watches and is even vintage-sized at 37.5mm (and water-resistant to 30m). That diameter should help balance out the thickness typically dictated by chronograph movements — though the use of a manually wound movement here does offer a slightly thinner profile at just under 13mm, including the domed crystal. The movement in question is the uncommon Sellita SW510M, which offers a pleasingly symmetrical 3-6-9 sub-dial layout and 58 hours of power reserve. Forgoing a date window uncomfortably wedged at 4:30 was probably the right choice.

The two versions at launch feature a silver dial with blue sub-dials, and this look’s reverse: a blue dial with silver sub-dials. Each has a colorful yachting-timer motif in the chronograph minutes sub-dial — which might seem slightly odd paired with an unexplained pulsometer scale on the silver dial version. In all, however, these are aesthetic cues a lot of vintage watch fans get excited about. Another bonus for certain buyers will be the local connection, with “Midwest” on the dial and a Great Lakes motif on the case back, the watches being assembled by Haven in Indiana and Minnesota. Available directly from the brand, orders for the Haven Chilton will ship in August 2019 for a price of $1,799.","__label__Positive"

449,"Fashion Had a Playdate with Camp During the Fall Collections","Add the name Lord Sebastian Flyte to your list of camp icons. The brainchild of Evelyn Waugh, this Adonis of an aristocrat is known for making outré statements such as, “I must have pillar-box red pajamas,” and for carrying around his teddy bear, Aloysius. Should you care to do the same, there are fashionable options on offer as designers borrowed less from the boys than from the toy chest for Fall.
Getting in on the action was The Elder Statesman’s Greg Chait, who made a colorful ursine backpack, and Vivetta Ponti who paid homage to Franco Moschino’s cuddly teddy bear coat (featured on the October 1998 cover of Vogue) with her own version. Jeremy Scott, Moschino’s current creative head, included a Troll doll-print in his collection. Making a splash chez Cynthia Rowley was Spongebob Square Pants, a favorite of Marc Jacobs, who not only has a tattoo of the cartoon character, but carried a bag featuring the little rascal at his Spring 2008 show for Louis Vuitton. (The models toted sacks by Richard Prince.)
Marc Jacobs takes a bow after his Fall 2008 collection for Louis Vuitton.
More storybook-like were the naive motifs that popped up at Bally, Bode, and Lanvin, where both Babar and the fairytale baddy, the sly fox, were used as accents. Meanwhile, the MM6 design team created a dress that looked like a flat balloon, a reminder that camp is largely about inflation, exaggeration—and having fun with fashion.","__label__Neutral"

If you have an important point to make, don’t try to be subtle or clever. Use the pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time; a tremendous whack. — Sir Winston Churchill

As Moses and his brother, Aaron, prepare to meet with Pharaoh, to demand the release of the Israelite slaves, God gives them some advance notice as to what will happen and what they should do.

God advises them that Pharaoh will ask for some type of sign that they are indeed divine messengers. God indicates that at that juncture Moses shall instruct Aaron to grab his staff and perform a miracle.

The Berdichever notices that in the verse there is a seemingly extraneous word. The translation reads “give for yourselves a sign.” The normally word-efficient Torah could have easily transcribed “give a sign.” Why the superfluous “for yourselves”?

The Berdichever answers that according to the great Kabbalist, R’ Isaac Luria, God is listening to our every word. Furthermore, God gets tremendous pleasure from us when those words are words of Torah, of Mitzvot, of good deeds and kindness. Even beyond that, God, through those positive words that we utter, actually blesses us, and enables the good happenstances in our lives. Our words, the positive utterances of our mouth, have a direct impact on ourselves, on our world, on our reality.

The addition of “for yourselves” in the verse comes to highlight that Aaron and Moses, who dedicated themselves to only good and to the service of God, had the power to affect and change reality just by the power of speech. Just by the words they used and their intention, they were able to bend and contravene the laws of nature and do the miraculous. They could turn a staff into a reptile and then turn that reptile back into a staff. They could be God’s agents in bringing down the miraculous plagues upon Egypt. All just from the incredible power of their speech. They understood the power they had harnessed in devoting the words that came out of their mouths to God and Israel.

May our words ever be powerfully good – and if they can’t be, may we learn the more valuable lesson of when to be quiet.","__label__Neutral"

Please contact us in case of abuse. In case of abuse,

The Zen Buddhist path is known for celebrating a state-of-mind called “not-knowing,” sometimes termed “beginner’s mind”. In this childlike state of wonder and innocence, we look at the world as it is, without our usual assumptions and preconceptions. We let down our mental defenses, allowing ourselves to be more intimate with reality.

It is less well-known that many traditional Judaism sources offer a similar teaching. In fact, many might find this downright surprising, as the most common forms of Jewish practice seem to strongly privilege the intellect and knowledge. This is not the place for a comprehensive history of rationalism in our tradition, but suffice to say that Greek philosophy and the Enlightenment wielded a significant influence over how our people’s thought and practice developed.

Yet for many of our great spiritual teachers, Purim is the apex of our tradition’s embrace of not-knowing. This theme lies at the heart of both the Purim story, the Megillah, and our festive celebrations. Its is, in fact, central to its great joyfulness, which is unparalleled in our calendar.

Given that our mystics elevate Purim even above Yom Kippur (Tikunei Zohar 21, p. 57b), which is commonly revered as the holiest day in our calendar, the festival and its emphasis on not-knowing deserve thorough investigation .

Beginning with the story of the Megillah, the Talmud teaches that when the evil Haman was drawing lots to choose the date for the Jews’ annihilation, he made a crucial error.

When the lot fell on Adar, Haman rejoiced greatly, for he said: “The lot has fallen on the month that Moses died!” And he did not know that on the 7th of Adar, Moses died, and on the 7th of Adar he was born. (Megillah 13b)

Haman is the epitome of a wicked, vindictive villain. But his mistake here is not so dramatic or extreme. He did something that most of us do very often; he made a decision on the basis of specific information. From the talmudic perspective, Haman was quite correct to assume that the month of Moses’ death would be a challenging one for our people, but he neglected to consider how Moses’ birth might affect the equation.

In his certainty that he knew all the relevant data, he brought about his own destruction.

There are many other examples from the Purim story where this principle surfaces, but nowhere as powerfully as the conversation at the crux of the whole Megillah, between the heroine and hero, Esther and Mordechai. While trying to convince Esther to risk her life in order to speak up for her people, Mordechai speaks the key words of the entire story:

“Do not imagine to yourself that you will escape in the king’s house from among all the Jews. For if you remain silent at this time, relief and rescue will arise for the Jews from elsewhere, and you and your father’s household will perish; and who knows if you attained your royal position for a time like this?” (Esther 4:13-14)

Who knows?! Consider how high the stakes are at this point: the entire Jewish People is bound for annihilation. Mordechai is apparently certain that the people will be saved, somehow. But even though he is trying to convince Esther to risk her life, he does not feign certainty about her role in this drama. In stead, he throws up his hands in humble not-knowing.

Esther is convinced by Mordechai’s honest, open-ended approach and she assumes control of the situation, setting in motion a chain of events that saves her people. In the course of that process, everything that Haman had planned, that seemed so solidly grounded on facts, is turned neatly on its head, providing us with one the Megillah’s most celebrated, quoted and sang verses:

And so, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month—that is, the month of Adar—when the king’s command and decree were to be executed, the very day on which the enemies of the Jews had expected to get them in their power, [the decree] was inverted, and the Jews got their enemies in their power. (Esther 9:1)

And while we sing these words celebrating the inversion of Haman’s plan, we perform a ritual unique in our entire tradition. We intoxicate ourselves, as the talmudic sage Rava instructs us, until we “do not know the difference between ‘Cursed is Haman’ and ‘Blessed is Mordechai’” (Megillah 7b).

Rava might have said that we are to intoxicate ourselves until we do not know night from day or left from right. But instead, he specified attaining a state beyond any moral certainty. It is not merely who Haman and Mordechai are that he urges us to lose sight of, but their moral standing.

In other words, Rava wants us to entirely release our moral compass. This is a shocking and potentially dangerous suggestion. Not surprisingly, many of our sages have sought to minimize its application, but nonetheless Rava’s teaching still offers us an insight into the spiritual work of Purim.

We witness the spirit of his teaching in the performance of three other Purim rituals: disguising ourselves, giving gifts to friends and listening to the Megillah.

Despite a calendar full of festivals and other opportunities for celebration, we mask ourselves only on Purim. In doing so, we embody the hidden truth of our own identities and of the mysterious Source of all Life, who guides the events of the Megillah, and the world, with a hidden hand.

We send gifts to friends as part of our festive celebrations, and the custom has evolved to do so via a messenger, adding an element of mystery and playfulness to the act.

And as for hearing the Megillah, knowing it or reciting by heart is not sufficient to fulfill our obligation; it must be read carefully from a scroll, and every word should be heard clearly. The Megillah, in which the Divine is not mentioned but merely alluded to, must be listened to as if for the first time, with what some might call beginner’s mind.

The final month of our calendar might seem like a strange time for such an emphasis on beginning, but in fact Purim is the perfect spiritual preparation for Pesach, which always falls on the following full moon. As the great Chasidic master, Rav Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin, taught, by entering into a state of not-knowing on Purim, we merit the illumination of Pesach (Likutei Ma’amarim Months and Festivals Ch. 5).

One way of understanding this is that since Pesach is a festival of rebirth and recreating our own story, the not-knowing of Purim is the necessary act of pressing Reset on our conscious mind, to allow for something new to emerge. So happy beginner’s mind – Purim Sameach!

995,"How to avoid bad bets on NCAA Tournament bubble teams","KeVaughn Allen and the Florida Gators appear to be firmly on the NCAA Tournament bubble. Getty Images

In all sports, bettors have a tendency to make bad bets on “must-win” teams. They figure motivation is something that transcends points or price, and will inspire players to peak performance. This is especially true when a “must-win” scenario is lined up against an opponent “with nothing to play for.”

Mid-February is when “bubble” talk moves front and center in mainstream media coverage of college basketball. Everyone’s looking forward to the NCAA Tournament. Many teams are already locks. Dozens more have no chance to get in unless they win their conference tournaments. A small subset is neither safely in nor yet in need of a miracle.

Put those two factors together, and you have potential potholes all over the betting card from now through the end of conference tournaments.

You’re going to be tempted to bet all the “must-win” Dance hopefuls you’re hearing about on TV coverage. And, if you’re a typical bettor, really tempted to lay points with them at home against visitors lacking motivation. Those are going to seem like gifts to the uninitiated. They’re not.

Think about it this way. For a team to still be on the bubble this deep into the season, it must be unable to control its own destiny against most opponents. Bubble teams can get hot and spring upsets, but they’re upset fodder themselves against lesser opponents. They probably possess a strength that opponents must guard against, but also a glaring weakness that’s easily exploited.

And, it’s not like it’s a big secret who the bubble teams are. You’re not catching the market napping by betting them. In some cases you’re paying a premium because oddsmakers know the public wants to bet high-profile bubble teams, and shades the line against that tendency.

Why lay an extra half-point or point with a mediocrity that has a glaring weakness? You might get away with it once or twice. Over the large batch of possible betting options the next few weeks, asking inconsistent performers to lift their games is probably going to be a money-losing strategy.

It is worth considering trying to find one or two tweeners who are just now playing their best basketball of the season. Maybe a team that was dealing with injuries before, but is now healthy. Maybe a very young team that learned from its early-season mistakes and improved its skill set. Maybe there’s a case of “addition by subtraction” and a negative on-court influence is no longer in the rotation.

Some teams do peak late. And, there are occasional super-surgers motivated by a sense of urgency about reaching the Dance. The key is finding situations where motivation is a nice ingredient in a cocktail, rather than the only reason for betting.

You’re about to be inundated with “bracketology” coverage that focuses on bubble teams. Oddsmakers watch TV too! Dodge the hype and focus on betting for value.","__label__Neutral"
673,"Progressives back Pelosi for speaker — in return for more power","The Democratic leader promises plum committee spots and more sway over legislation.

It wasn’t a coincidence that moments after Nancy Pelosi promised progressive House leaders more power in the next Congress, a host of liberal groups announced they were supporting her for speaker.

Rep. Pramila Jayapal, who is expected to co-chair the House Progressive Caucus next year, left a Thursday night meeting with Pelosi in the Capitol and proclaimed that her members would have more seats on powerful committees and more influence over legislation.

The Washington state Democrat then phoned MoveOn and Indivisible with the news, and they promptly tweeted out support for Pelosi. Then, on Friday morning, Jayapal, previously uncommitted on whom she would back for speaker, gave Pelosi a full-throated endorsement.

“No one can really doubt Pelosi’s progressive chops,” Jayapal told POLITICO in an interview. “And I do think, for the next two years, as we lead into 2020, and are coming off this big wave, we need someone who is smart and strategic and has done this.”

She went on to note that the 15 to 20 Pelosi critics trying to oust her are more centrist in their ideology and goals than the rest of the caucus. If Democrats remove her, Jayapal argued, they would effectively be turning their backs on the voters who swept Democrats into power.

“That drive is not going to take us in the direction that we should go,” Jayapal said of the effort to depose Pelosi. “It’s going to be the opposite of what the election really told us, which is a much more diverse, progressive, bold agenda.”

Pelosi's overtures also speak to progressives’ growing influence in the Democratic Caucus. The Progressive Caucus will increase its membership by at least 20 members next year, and comprise about two-fifths of the caucus. Its leaders intend to use those numbers to boost their power and agenda — starting first with committee assignments and leadership positions, then expanding into legislation.

Adding to that heft is their relationship with powerful groups on the outside — organizations that Jayapal argues are the main reason Democrats retook the majority.

“We coordinated very closely with them, and they actually told Pelosi that they won’t come out for her until [after] our meeting,” Jayapal said. “So we are leveraging our power in different ways within the caucus but also with our allies on the outside.”

Thursday's meeting with Pelosi included Jayapal and current Progressive Caucus Co-Chair Mark Pocan (D-Wis.). One request to which Pelosi agreed was to give the Progressive Caucus proportional representation on what lawmakers call the “A committees”: the Appropriations, Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, Financial Services and Intelligence committees.","__label__Neutral"
1785,"Here’s Where To Buy Taco Bell’s New Shredded Cheese Flavors For Your Next Taco Night","Taco night is a legit day of the week at my house. Each Tuesday night, I cook up shredded chicken or beef alongside a variety of toppings like pico, guac, chopped lettuce, hot sauce, and Monterey Jack cheese. I'm always looking to spice things up and I've found just the product to really amp of the flavor of my weekly taco night. I recently came across Taco Bell's new shredded cheese flavors during a trip to the grocery store last week. Wondering where you can get a bag or two for yourself? Here's where to buy Taco Bell's new shredded cheese flavors to amp up your next taco night. Elite Daily reached out to Taco Bell but did not hear back at the time of publication.

Taco Bell's new shredded cheese lineup includes flavors like Zesty Ranch , Breakfast Fiesta , 7-Layer Blend , and Salsa Verde . Seriously, each one sounds so good it's going to be hard to pick a flavor to start with. Taco Bell is known for its cheese-filled menu items like the Cheesy Gordita Crunch and the Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes . So, it only makes sense that the Mexican fast-food chain would roll out four flavors of shredded cheese products to help you recreate your favorites at home.

I spotted the new flavors while I was out shopping for groceries and running errands at the end of January and I seriously couldn't believe my eyes. I was in the dairy aisle of my local Target scanning for a block of parmesan when my eyes met a plastic black bag, about halfway up in the cooler. It was like Christmas morning all over again. (PSA: I love cheese and tacos.)

Each flavor of Taco Bell shredded cheese retails for $3.19 a piece , according to the product listing on Target's website. Delish, a food news website, reports that the four new flavors are also available at Meijer . I was able to find one of the flavors for sale on Instacart , too.

I'm definitely going to grab a bag of Zesty Ranch for my next taco night. This flavor combines some of my favorite things: Monterey Jack cheese and ranch seasoning . I'm pretty sure I'd put ranch on just about anything if it was socially acceptable, but that's beside the point. Although, the Salsa Verde blend could be used on anything like salads and quesadillas. It's made up of Monterey Jack cheese, sharp white cheddar , regular sharp cheddar, mild cheddar cheese, and salsa verde seasoning.

The Breakfast Fiesta blend is a mixture of shredded cheddar cheese with a hint of bacon and smoke flavorings for a big bite. This is a game changer for anyone who eats scrambled eggs. It also sounds fantastic in a breakfast casserole. The possibilities are limitless.

And then, there's the blend that was basically made for tacos. Taco Bell's Taco Night flavor is a bag of shredded cheddar cheese , just like you might find inside of a Crunchy Taco from the fast-food joint.

I haven't been back to the store since I first saw these new shredded cheese blends about a week or so ago. It's possible that the new products are available at other grocery stores that sell other Taco Bell products. Keep an out during your next shopping trip.","__label__Positive"
1072,"Arizona Governor Signs Executive Order After Incapacitated Woman Gives Birth","Arizona Governor Doug Ducey has issued an executive order to increase protections for patients in long term care facilities. The announcement comes a day after former nurse Nathan Sutherland pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a 29-year-old woman in an incapacitated state who was under his care at Hacienda Healthcare in Phoenix. The rape came to light when the woman – who has been in long term care since a near drowning incident when she was three years old – gave birth to a baby boy on December 29th. Hacienda Healthcare Staff allegedly did not know she was pregnant until she began moaning and went into labor. Investigators say that Sutherland's DNA matched a sample taken from the infant, who is being cared for by the woman's relatives. Sutherland remains jailed on a $500,000 bond. In the wake of the assault, Hacienda Healthcare's CEO resigned. And on Wednesday, Governor Duce ordered state agencies to review protocols and develop training in order to prevent, recognize the signs and symptoms of, and report the abuse and neglect of patients with disabilities. The report also requires long term care facilities like Hacienda Healthcare to ""apply for state licenses and perform background checks on staff who interact with patients."" In a statement introducing the order Ducey said, “All Arizonans deserve to be safe ― and we have a special responsibility to protect those with disabilities. This executive order provides increased accountability and stricter oversight, ensuring our most vulnerable are safe and protected.”","__label__Neutral"
616,"J. League grants Vanraure Hachinohe entry as 54th club","The J. League welcomed its 54th club on Tuesday after its board of directors approved the admittance of Aomori Prefecture’s Vanraure Hachinohe to the league’s third division.

Hachinohe, which had already received its J3 club license earlier this year, fulfilled entry requirements by finishing third this year in the Japan Football League.

With Vanraure joining Blaublitz Akita, Fukushima United, Iwate Prefecture’s Grulla Morioka, Miyagi Prefecture’s Vegalta Sendai, and Montedio Yamagata, all six prefectures in the Tohoku region are represented by J. League clubs.

“I hope (Tohoku’s clubs) will all work hard to excite the league,” J. League chairman Mitsuru Murai told Vanraure chairman Kentaro Hosogoe by phone.

Hachinohe’s path to the J. League took 12 years following its formation from a merger of Aomori sides Hachinohe Industry SC and Nango FC. The club first attempted to join the J. League in time for the J3’s inaugural season in 2014, but was denied on the grounds of insufficient facilities and instead joined the JFL.

The club was finally granted a J3 license in 2016 after the completion of Daihatsu Stadium, a multi-use facility that can also serve as an evacuation center in the event of a tsunami. Hachinohe, based in the southeast of the prefecture, suffered heavy damage to its port during the March 11, 2011 disaster.

“(Vanraure) has created a firm foundation … I have high expectations for the club,” Murai told a news conference. “Playing in a stadium built in an area hard-hit by the tsunami has made it a symbol of the region’s recovery. They have a lot of potential.”

Vanraure was the only club to earn promotion from the JFL after J3 license-holding FC Imabari, chaired by former Samurai Blue head coach Takeshi Okada, finished just outside the promotion zone in fifth place.

The league also announced that first-division clubs FC Tokyo, Gamba Osaka and Cerezo Osaka will continue to field U-23 squads in the third flight next year, raising the total number of participating clubs to 18.","__label__Neutral"
2697,"Feds bust drug ring run out of upstate New York firehouse","Local and federal agents busted a major drug ring Tuesday run by an upstate New York fire lieutenant out of the city’s central firehouse, according to a report.
Longtime smoke-eater Lt. Paul G. Smith of the Middletown Fire Department, the alleged leader of the ring, was among about 20 people who were arrested in connection to the drug bust, the RecordOnline.com reported .
New York State Police and agents from the FBI and DEA staged a series of raids in Orange and Rockland counties Tuesday morning to take down the suspects.
Smith, along with two other men, Garey Michel and Marquis Gamble, were charged with operating as a major trafficker, according to the news outlet.
The men and the other defendants in the case were also hit with charges of second-degree conspiracy.
During Michel’s arraignment, Orange County Assistant District Attorney Neal Eriksen told a judge that the defendants conspired to sell 30-milligram oxycodone tablets “which were, in fact, fentanyl pills,” according to the news outlet.
Michel made more than $70,000 in a span of six months from the scheme, Eriksen said.
Another man busted in connection to the case was Dominick Guardino, the chief of the Mechanicstown Fire Department in Middletown, RecordOnline.com reported.
The prosecutor charged that Guardino obtained pills while in his department-issued vehicle. He faces one count of conspiracy.
Four other men Joel Gamble, 44, Robert Dunham Jr,, George Thomas, 62, and Samuel Marino were also arraigned on conspiracy charges in relation to the distribution of cocaine, according to the news outlet.
Smith, who has been employed by the Middletown Fire Department since March 2002, was expected to be arraigned later Tuesday.
Judge Craig Brown set bail at $1 million cash for Michel and Dunham, $500,000 cash for Joel Gamble, $100,000 cash for Marino, $50,000 cash for Guardino and $75,000 cash for Thomas, according to the report.","__label__Neutral"
2466,"Video Shows Cops Respond to Hostage Situation by Killing the Hostage—No One Fired","( Support Free Thought ) - Los Angeles, CA — Los Angeles police  previously released  graphic body camera footage, showing officers opening fire on a man armed with a knife who’d taken a 49-year-old woman hostage. In the shooting, police killed both the man with the knife, and the innocent hostage. Now, the department is claiming that the officers who opened fire on the innocent women are being “disciplined.” However, they will face no criminal charges and will likely not even be fired.
On Tuesday, a civilian oversight panel ruled that two of the three cops who responded to the scene that day violated department policy on the use of deadly force. It will now be up to LAPD Chief Michel Moore to decide exactly what “discipline” measures he will take with the officers.
The LAPD identified the officers who responded to the Van Nuys hostage situation as Eugene Damiano, Andrew Trock and Cristian Bonilla but they made no mention of who was found in violation.
According to a 911 recording, officers were called to the scene on June 16, 2018, after a woman reported that a man had stabbed someone at her location. When officers arrived, they found Guillermo Perez, 32, who had just stabbed his ex-girlfriend with a knife.
According to police, Perez had a violent past and was recently released from prison after being convicted of robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, and domestic violence. Meanwhile, thousands of non-violent drug offenders remain in cages.
When officers confronted Perez, he held a chair as a shield and a large knife. As officers yelled for Perez to drop the knife, he did not comply.
At this point, officers opened fire on Perez with bean bag rounds, according to Moore. However, the chair shielded him from the blasts.
“He moved away from officers and grabbed an innocent bystander who was standing nearby. Perez began to cut the innocent bystander’s throat with a knife. That’s when three officers shot at Perez to stop his actions and prevent him from killing the hostage,” the chief said.
When Perez grabbed the innocent bystander, 49-year-old Elizabeth Tollison as a hostage, officers unleashed a torrent of gunfire. In total, officers fired 18 rounds, several of which struck Tollison, killing her.
“The life of the hostage is paramount and protecting that individual from the threat of the assailant, and in doing that, the balancing act that the officer has – is how to protect them by stopping the suspect’s actions,” Moore said at the time. “This was a tense situation that unfolded very quickly. It’s every officer’s worst nightmare.”
Justifying his future lack of “discipline,” according to the  LA Times,  “Moore said other officers with similar experience and training would have reasonably believed Perez presented an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.”
But one of the officers “did not have a viable sight picture” of Perez before firing, which caused an “extreme potential for risk of injury to the hostage,” Moore said.
In the case of the second officer found to have violated policy, Moore said he took into “consideration the rapidly unfolding tactical situation” in which the officer made a “split-second decision under stressful circumstances.”
Judging from the chief’s comments it is highly unlikely that these officers will face anything more than a write-up or a short suspension, otherwise known as a vacation.
As for the family of the innocent hostage, they have filed a wrongful death suit against the city and the department.
Sadly, Tollison was the second hostage in only 6 weeks to be killed by LAPD officers. As TFTP  reported  last July, Melyda Corado, 27, was an assistant manager at a Trader Joe’s grocery store and her life ended tragically when her workplace became the scene where a police chase ended and officers started to exchange gunfire with the suspect they had been pursuing.
The Los Angeles Police Department has been surprisingly open with the public, and Moore admitted that the bullets that struck and killed Corado were fired by LAPD officers.
“The source of that round, we’ve recovered it, and ballistically we believe it’s from one of the two officers,” Moore said. “The fatal bullet first hit (Corado’s) arm, then entered her body.”
Just like he did in the incident above, the police chief attempted to defend the actions of the officers by claiming that they “had to make a split-second decision. I’m here to say that that is the worst, worst decision that any officer ever wishes to have to make.”
In Corado’s case, the assailant police were after, Gene Evin Atkins, 28, was unharmed in the shooting.

2062,"Swarms of tiny satellites could act like one giant space telescope","It won’t be long before the James Webb Space Telescope is launched, an enormous and complex feat of engineering — but all one piece. That’s a good thing for now, but new research suggests that in the near future giant telescopes like the Webb might be replaced (or at least augmented) by swarms of tiny spacecraft working in concert.

One advance, from Ben-Gurion University in Israel, is a leap in the capabilities of what are called synthetic aperture systems. It’s a technique where a single small camera moves across a space, capturing images as it goes, and by very careful analysis of the data it collects, it can produce imagery like that created by a much larger camera — essentially synthesizing a bigger aperture.

As documented in a paper published today in Optica , the team leapfrogs existing methods in an interesting way. Two satellites move in synchrony around the edge of a circle, collecting data as they go and beaming it to a third stationary one; this circle describes the synthetic aperture the two cameras are creating.

“We found that you only need a small part of a telescope lens to obtain quality images,” explained BGU grad student Angika Bulbul, who led the research, in a news release . “Even by using the perimeter aperture of a lens, as low as 0.43 percent, we managed to obtain similar image resolution compared to the full aperture area of mirror/lens-based imaging systems.”

In other words, they were basically able to get the results of a camera 50 times the size. That would be impressive anywhere, but up in space it’s especially important. Putting something as huge and complex as the Webb into orbit is an incredibly complicated and drawn out endeavor. And it’s putting a lot of eggs in one (very carefully checked and rechecked) basket.

But if you could instead use a handful of satellites working together, and just replace one if it fails, that really opens up the field. “We can slash the huge cost, time and material needed for gigantic traditional optical space telescopes with large curved mirrors,” Bulbul said.

One of the challenges of space telescopes, however, is that they need to take measurements with extreme precision. And keeping a satellite perfectly still is hard enough, to say nothing of having it move perfectly to within fractions of a millimeter.

To keep on track, right now many satellites use reliable fixed sources of light, like bright stars, as reference points when calculating various things relating to their operations. Some astronomers have even used lasers to excite a point high in the atmosphere to provide a sort of artificial star for these systems to use.

These methods both have their strengths and weaknesses, but MIT researchers think they’ve found a more permanent, high-precision solution: a “guide star” satellite that would sit thousands of miles out and train a strong laser on the Earth and its orbital region.

This light source would be reliable, steady and highly visible; satellites could use it to calculate their position and the minute changes to their imaging apparatus caused by heat and radiation, perhaps to a degree not possible with actual stars or atmospheric dots.

Both these intriguing technologies are still very much in the lab, but theory is where all big advances start, and it could be that in a few years, swarms of satellites will be sent into space not to provide terrestrial communications, but to create a massive synthetic telescope looking out on the universe.","__label__Neutral"
2318,"Elliman’s Michael Graves leaps to Compass","Douglas Elliman’s Michael Graves — a new development and luxury broker with more than $326 million in listings — is moving to Compass.

Graves, who joined Elliman in 2013 and once appeared on HGTV’s “Selling New York,” has sold more than $1 billion worth of real estate to date, according to the venture-backed firm.

Graves, who resigned from Elliman on Tuesday, said his decision was rooted in the rapid changes taking place in the real estate industry — including disruption by new technology and an infusion of cash from investors.

“Compass is the most forward-thinking, tech-savvy company in the industry right now,” he said, adding that he was extremely grateful for his time at Elliman.

Graves is a Minnesota native and classical guitarist who became a broker in 2009. Before Elliman, he was a top agent at CORE. In addition to his brokerage chops, Graves appeared on HGTV’s “Selling New York.” Before brokerage, he worked for his family’s hotel company, Graves Hospitality Corp., in Minneapolis.

According to Compass, Graves currently represents $326.5 million worth of listings, including $129.5 million in-contract deals.

His active listings include a condo at One Madison that’s asking $13.75 million and a townhouse at 68 East 91st Street, asking $11.825 million. Graves is also on the team that’s marketing the Chetrit Group and Clipper Equity’s Gramercy Square condominium makeover of the old Cabrini Medical Center on East 20th Street. The 223-unit project has a total projected sellout of $817.5 million.

It’s unclear how many of those listings Graves will be able to bring to Compass.

The seven-year old firm, headed by Robert Reffkin and Ori Allon, has ramped up hiring again in New York after closing a $400 million round from SoftBank and Qatar Investment Authority in September. That round valued the firm at a staggering $4.4 billion.

Compass now claims to be the third-largest residential brokerage in the U.S., with 238 offices (up from 62 in 2017). In New York City, the firm now has 12 offices and 1,440 agents.","__label__Neutral"
511,"Exclusive: Washington Post Working With Mueller Inquisition to Frame Roger Stone & Alex Jones","The Washington Post is set to publish a false story claiming that Jerome Corsi was hired by Infowars at the behest of Roger Stone as part of a “hush money” operation and that this is a line of inquiry for the Mueller investigation into Russian collusion.

Alex Jones delivers an emergency message to all patriots!

Corsi is under investigation for information alleging that he possessed advance knowledge that WikiLeaks had hacked the emails of John Podesta and passed this information on to Stone.

In an email sent yesterday to lawyer Marc Randazza, the Washington Post’s Rosalind Helderman states, “I’ve been able to confirm that Robert Mueller’s investigators have been asking witnesses about the financial relationship between Infowars and Jerome Corsi and Roger Stone’s role in helping Corsi get his Infowars job.”

Asking why Infowars hired Corsi, Helderman states, “Mueller seems to be exploring that the job was hush money in some way.”

Corsi was hired by Infowars in January 2017 to set up a Washington bureau. His contract renewed in January 2018 but then the relationship was ended in June 2018. Corsi was paid routine 6 months severance pay.

Corsi was hired at a time when the Roger Stone-Corsi conspiracy theory nexus tied to Wikileaks was not even being circulated. Corsi was fired because of his failure to adequately establish a Washington bureau, his failure to maintain White House press credentials, and his generally poor work performance.

Infowars hiring Corsi had nothing whatsoever to do with Wikileaks or any kind of “hush money” operation, which is an absurd claim. He was hired to establish a DC presence for Infowars. This took place almost two years before Corsi was subpoenaed to testify in the Special Counsel investigation.

This false report shows the lengths the media and the Mueller investigation is prepared to go to in order to frame Roger Stone and Alex Jones.

The Washington Post is trying to spin standard severance pay as proof of some sort of ‘collusion’ – with no evidence whatsoever to back it up.

The idea that Alex Jones and his father, Dr. David Jones, would be engaged in such a scheme is completely ludicrous.

The witch hunt against prominent Trump supporters in the media is intensifying, with attempts to entrap innocent people becoming routine. Many have buckled under the pressure, but Jones and Stone refuse to back down.

The move represents a huge inquisition and an effort to set up and persecute any prominent supporter of Trump or anyone in his orbit in anticipation of impeaching Trump himself.

Jerry Corsi’s claim that he provided a memo to me regarding the Podesta brothers business dealings as part of a “cover-up “is both categorically false and ludicrous not to mention illogical. Cover up for what? Corsi claim that he told me that John Podesta’s emails had been stolen is without foundation or corroboration.

My tweet regarding the Podesta brothers of Aug 21 was not controversial for six weeks after I posted it and is based on information regarding their Russian business dealings from all public sources. Exactly what act did I need to cover up?

It should be noted that Dr. Corsi denies having any communication or contact with the WikiLeaks or Julian Assange whatsoever.

This is certainly reflected in the fact that all of Dr. Corsi‘s prognostications regarding the WikiLeaks disclosures to me turned out to be incorrect.

Corsi’s claim that I knew about the NBC/Billy Bush tape in advance and directed him to do anything about it is yet another lie without a shred of evidence or corroboration to prove this baseless charge.

I did recommend him for his position at InfoWars where he served as Washington bureau chief until he was fired after a drunken meltdown in a Washington DC restaurant. I also recommended him for various freelance writing gigs because he is both an excellent writer and researcher.

I assisted him because he was constantly whining about being broke. The claim that any of my recommendations were arrangements for “hush money “is both ridiculous and false. I had no need of any such arrangement nor the ability to deliver employment to him for anything other than actual work performed.

Any inquiry regarding Corsi’s compensation from Infowars should be directed to them as I am myself an independent contractor and as such am not privy to that information.

The deep state seeks to fabricate some misdeed by the Trump campaign that is sold as Russian collusion. That way they can remove both Donald Trump and vice President Mike Pence paving the way for Nancy Pelosi to become president. Pelosi will then appoint Hillary Clinton to the vacant Vice Presidency after which Pelosi would resign as president allowing Hillary to take the White House which alluded her grasp in 2016.","__label__Negative"

In the United States, people are supposed to be considered innocent until the government proves its case beyond a reasonable doubt in a courtroom. But with plea deals, theres no standard of evidence, no proof.
The Constitutions guarantee of a fair trial is disappearing.
Federal criminal defendants are being coerced to plead guilty, cautions the nonpartisan National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. There is no more heart wrenching task than explaining to an innocent person that they must seriously consider pleading guilty or risk the utter devastation of the remainder of their life.
Yet flipping has plenty of supporters. Peter Zeidenberg, a former federal prosecutor, claims its fundamental to the process. Without the threat, prosecutors wouldnt get defendants to provide information about other possible targets of investigation.
But how credible is that information if its extorted from a terrified defendant to save his own neck? Prosecutors have total discretion to send a letter to the sentencing judge urging no jail time at all for defendants who tell prosecutors what they want to hear. Defense lawyers caution that this practice entices defendants to embellish the facts or even lie.","__label__Neutral"

576,"ANN WILSON Of HEART Premiers Official Music Video For ""You Don't Own Me""","Ann Wilson of Heart has released an official video for her cover of the Lesley Gore hit, ""You Don't Own Me"", featured on Ann's Immortal album. Watch the clip below.

Ann previously commented on the song, revealing: ""'You Don't Own Me' was originally an early feminist anthem in the 1960's and '70's. Since then the idea of self possession has grown to be more universal...This song is about refusing to be objectified and owned. By anyone.""

With her cover of Tom Petty's ""Luna"" set as the newest song to be released from Immortal, Ann will serve as guest DJ on SiriusXM's Tom Petty Radio channel where she'll play the track alongside some of her favorite Petty songs like ""Room At The Top"" and ""A Woman in Love,"" among others. See the dates and times below.

Immortal features 10 musically diverse tracks that pay tribute to some of Ann's influences and friends who've recently passed and whose music poignantly lives on. Other highlights from the album include the Eagles' ""Life In The Fast Lane"" (in honor of Glenn Frey) and Cream's ""Politician"" (in honor of Jack Bruce), both of which have placed in the Top Ten of the Mediabase Classic Rock Tracks chart.

""'Luna' is perhaps my favorite Petty song; it's simple, romantic and aching,"" Ann says. ""The words say, 'Luna come to me tonight...I am a prisoner.' Speaking directly to the moon, as romantics will, there is a desire to be free in the moon's metaphysical power. Free from what or whom? Though it's only reflected light, the soul of the moon has inspired countless lovers, dreamers and existentialists for time immemorial. This song is a classic and I have reimagined it in a sultry, unhurried, southern mood with Warren Haynes on guitar as the voice of the moon.""

Ann's guest DJ session will premiere Monday, November 5th at 8 AM (ET) and 5 AM (PT) on SiriusXM's Tom Petty Radio via satellite on channel 31 and through the SiriusXM app on smartphones and other connected devices, as well as online. The guest DJ session will rebroadcast throughout the week on SiriusXM's Tom Petty Radio.

43,"NASA’s climate-monitoring space laser is the last to ride to space on a Delta II rocket","This weekend, NASA is launching a new high-tech satellite to monitor the planet’s glacier and sea ice levels — with space lasers, naturally. ICESat-2 will be a huge boon for climatologists, and it’s also a bittersweet occasion: it will be the final launch aboard the trusty Delta II rocket, which has been putting birds in the air for nearly 30 years.
Takeoff is set for 5:46 AM Pacific Time Saturday morning, so you’ll have to get up early if you want to catch it. You can watch the launch live here , with NASA coverage starting about half an hour before.
Keeping track of the Earth’s ice levels is more important than ever; with climate change causing widespread havoc, precise monitoring of major features like the Antarctic ice sheet could help climatologists predict and understand global weather patterns.
Like Aeolus, which launched in July, ICESat-2 is a spacecraft with a single major instrument, not a “Christmas tree” of sensors and antennas. And like Aeolus, ICESat-2 carries a giant laser . But while the first was launched to watch the movement of the air in-between it and the ground, the second must monitor the ground through that moving air.
It does so by using an industrial-size, hyper-precise altimeter: a single, powerful green laser split into six beams — three pairs of two, really, arranged to pass over the landscape in a predictable way.
But the real magic is how those lasers are detected. Next to the laser is a special telescope that watches for the beams’ reflections. Incredibly, it only collects “about a dozen” photons from each laser pulse, and times their arrival down to a billionth of a second. And it does this 10,000 times per second, which at its speed means a pulse is bouncing off the Earth every 2.3 feet or so.
As if that wasn’t impressive enough, its altitude readings are accurate down to the inch. And with multiple readings over time, it should be able to tell whether an ice sheet has risen or fallen on the order of millimeters.
So if you’re traveling in the Antarctic and you drop a pencil, be sure to pick it up or it might throw things off.
Of course, it’s not just for ice; the same space laser will also return the exact heights of buildings, tree canopies and other features. It’s a pity there aren’t more of these satellites — they sound rather useful.
Although ICESat-2 itself is notable and interesting, this launch is significant for a second reason: this will be the final launch atop a Delta II rocket. Rocketry standby United Launch Alliance is in charge of this one, as it has been for so many others.
Introduced in 1989, the Delta II has launched everything from communication satellites to Mars orbiters and landers; Spirit and Opportunity both left the Earth on Delta IIs. All told, more than 150 launches have been made on these rockets, and if Saturday’s launch goes as planned, it will be the 100th successful Delta II launch in a row. That’s a hell of a record. (To be clear, that doesn’t mean 50 failed; but a handful of failures over the decades have marred the launch vehicle’s streak.)
One charming yet perhaps daunting idiosyncrasy of the system is that someone somewhere has to literally click a button to initiate takeoff — no automation for this thing; it’s someone’s job to hit the gas, so they better look sharp.
The ULA’s Bill Cullen told Jason Davis of the Planetary Society, for his epitaph on the rocket :
Yes, the Delta II engine start command is initiated by a console operator. The launch control system is 25 years old, and at the time this used a ‘person in the loop’ control which was preferred compared to the complexities of a fault-tolerant computer system.
So why are we leaving this tried and true rocket behind? It’s expensive and not particularly big. With a payload capacity of 4 tons and a cost (for this mission anyway) approaching a hundred million dollars, it’s just not a good value any more. Not only that, but Launch Complex 2 at Vandenberg Air Base is the only place left on Earth with the infrastructure to launch it, which significantly limits the orbits and opportunities for prospective missions. After ICESat-2’s launch, even that will be torn down — though hopefully they’ll keep the pieces somewhere, for posterity.
Although this is the last Delta II to launch, there is one more rocket left without a mission, the last, as it were, on the lot. Plans are not solid yet, but it’s a good bet this classic rocket will end up in a museum somewhere — perhaps standing upright with others at Kennedy Space Center.","__label__Positive"

The California Public Utilities Commission said a new FCC ruling prevented the state from levying a tax on text plans. The state  hoped to add new monthly fees  onto wireless customers’ bills to increase funds for programs that bring connectivity to underserved residents. Regulators were scheduled to vote on the measure on January 10, 2019.

Proponents of the FCC’s new rule say it will give carriers the ability to crack down on spam messages, and critics say it could lead to carriers censoring messages. The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday.

The CPUC’s proposed text tax faced strong opposition from industry trade groups, including CTIA, which represents AT&amp;T Mobility, Sprint, and T-Mobile. (AT&amp;T is the parent company of CNN.)

The industry group said the CPUC proposal would have created inequity “between wireless carriers and other providers of messaging services,” such as WhatsApp, iMessage and Skype. In a legal filing, CTIA called the text tax plan “illogical, anticompetitive, and harmful to consumers.”

She said this was unfair to the children because they are not aware if they have been vaccinated, and could be the person spreading the disease to their schoolmates and local community.
""Vaccine intake is certainly the parents' decision, but it should be remembered, when death occurs this is a strong case, so do not wait for more death cases,"" she told Bernama.
Yeoh said this after delivering her keynote address at the Diversity and Inclusion In The Workplace 3: Raising The Bar programme, organised by the British Malaysian Chamber of Commerce Berhad which was also attended by its executive director, Jennifer Lopez.
The children, including three girls under the age of four, were diagnosed positive after 52 individuals were screened by the State Health Department.
One of the children is the sister of the 25-month old boy who died, believed to be due to diphtheria last Tuesday.
According to Yeoh, Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad in a statement on Sunday said that he would table a proposal and policy for immunisation vaccines to be made compulsory.
She said the ministry has not obtained the actual figures on children who have not been given immunisation, as this was under the jurisdiction of the Health Ministry.
Yeoh also expressed concern over the presence of anti-vaccine groups despite the fact that vaccine injections have been confirmed and scientifically proven to be safe and are given free of charge at government hospitals.

809,"How To Trade Wednesday's Fed Decision","The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Markets Committee is all but guaranteed to increase the federal funds rate after Wednesday’s meeting. The CME’s fed fund futures tool is giving a 0.25 percent hike a 93.8 chance of happening, and a 0.5 percent hike a 6.2 percent chance.

FOMC announcements are historically the most volatile times for interest rate securities, as the entire market will be watching to see the language Fed Chair Jerome Powell uses to describe future actions. As TD Ameritrade Chief Market Strategist JJ Kinahan put it, “When we already know what the outcome will be, it puts more emphasis on what they say going forward.”

Looking at the five main interest rate securities ahead of the meeting, they all look to be in clear downtrends. This is, of course, not a complete surprise considering treasuries have an inverse relationship to interest rates. But the market will be more interested in the Fed’s forward-looking statements on Wednesday. With that in mind, let’s take a look at what the charts tell us about what could happen to the most interest rate-sensitive securities in the coming days. We can use VantagePoint Software , which use artificial intelligence and intermarket analysis to make 1-3 day forecasts accurate up to 86 percent of the time, to forecast what will happen this week.

The 10-year US T-Note Futures have been in a steady downtrend for the last three months, which you can see on the chart below. The blue line represents a predicted moving average, while the black shows a simple 10-day moving average. As long as the blue stays below the black, that indicates a clear bearish signal.

We’ll also point out that VantagePoint’s Neural Index, which forecasts temporary strength or weakness in a given market, has mostly been in the red. Monday’s shift to green is promising, but we’ll need to see more before it’s time to get bullish.

The same can be said when looking at charts of 5-Year US T-Note Futures and 2-Year US T-Note Futures. Because T-Note futures are all heavily correlated, all three markets are currently forecasted to continue in their current downtrend throughout this week.","__label__Neutral"
2063,"Space Harpoon Successfully Snatches Floating Hunk of Space Junk - Gizmodo","Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag. Click here to view original GIF

A small satellite has captured a piece of space debris using a claw-tipped harpoon. The test represents an important technological achievement given our mounting space junk problem.

Called RemoveDEBRIS, the research project is an effort to test various space junk removal technologies. The project, which involves a 220-pound satellite in low Earth orbit, is being led by the University of Surrey and involves a consortium of space companies and research institutions, with some funding coming from the European Union, according to a statement .

During a recent test, the RemoveDEBRIS satellite shot a harpoon at a 4-inch-wide (10 centimeters) target held aloft by a five-foot-long (1.5-meter) boom, reports the BBC. The harpoon struck the aluminium honeycomb-like target at a speed of 65 feet per second (20 meters per second). In a video released by Surrey University, the claws at the tip of the harpoon can be seen digging into the target upon contact, enabling a firm lock. The object was torn away from the boom, which wasn’t a problem given that the harpoon is tethered by a wire to the satellite.

In a statement, Guglielmo Aglietti, Director of the Surrey Space Centre, said this particular RemoveDEBRIS experiment was “the most demanding” yet, and a “testament to all involved.”

This is the third successful test for RemoveDEBRIS. Previously, the satellite deployed a net to capture a simulated piece of space junk, and a laser-based camera system was used to locate a floating chunk of space debris. A fourth and final experiment will be conducted in March, when the satellite will pump the brakes by deploying a small sail. With its velocity greatly diminished, the satellite, and in theory anything it has captured, will fall back toward Earth and burn up on re-entry.","__label__Neutral"

In a review published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, researchers said the worsening epidemics could spread beyond Venezuela's borders, potentially causing a regional public health emergency.

""As well as the return of measles and other vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, the continued upsurge in malaria could soon become uncontrollable,"" said Martin Llewellyn, a doctor and senior lecturer at Britain's Glasgow University who led the review with researchers from Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil and Ecuador.

He said that with its health care system collapsing and a dramatic drop in public health programs and disease surveillance, vector-borne diseases - those transmitted by insects such as mosquitoes and ticks - are on the rise and have spread into new territories across Venezuela.

The country was declared by the World Health Organization to have eradicated malaria in 1961.

Llewellyn's team analyzed published and unpublished data and found that between 2010 and 2015, Venezuela saw an estimated 359 percent rise in malaria cases. This was followed by a 71 percent rise between 2016 and 2017 because of a decline in mosquito-control activities and shortages in medication.

The review also found the crisis is having dramatic effects on other vector-borne diseases in Venezuela. Active transmission of Chagas disease, for example, is the highest seen in 20 years, and incidence of dengue fever has risen more than five-fold.

Outbreaks of two other mosquito-borne diseases - chikungunya and Zika - also appear to be increasing, the researchers found.

The researchers said their findings should also be seen in the context of mass emigration. With an average of 5,500 people leaving Venezuela every day in 2018, they said, neighboring countries face the risk of potential imports of infectious disease outbreaks.","__label__Neutral"

2018 has been a monumental year for Kylie Jenner. Not only is her billion-dollar cosmetics company thriving, but her love life is solid and she became a first-time mom. And that last accomplishment is what she seems most proud of. Jenner is so proud of being a mommy that she frequently shares her journey on social media. So, it makes sense that Kylie Jenner’s 2018 best nine is full of her daughter Stormi Webster. The 10-month-old is pretty much all over Jenner's best nine and all the photos are super cute!
Jenner’s 2018 best nine is full of all the special Stormi moments she’s shared with her Instagram followers since her daughter was born in February. Those moments include the really big ones, like when Jenner first announced that she had given birth and the world’s very first glimpse of Stormi, which was just a shot of her little hand.
For those of you who don’t remember (and really, how could you forget?), Jenner’s entire pregnancy was shrouded in secrecy. And that led to an Instagram announcement that basically set the internet ablaze with excitement. In announcing the birth of her daughter, Stormi, Jenner apologized for keeping fans “in the dark.”
“I’m sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions,” Jenner wrote in the post. “I understand you’re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. my pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world. I knew for myself i needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way i knew how. there was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal i had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.”
See a glimpse of Jenner’s 2018 best nine down below:
One of the other moments included in Jenner’s best nine is the post that showed the world its very first photo of little Stormi. In the photo, which was published just days after the birth, you can see Stormi’s fingers gripping Jenner’s. It’s really sweet. Have a look:
Another adorable photo in Jenner’s best nine is one from October 2018 where the mommy-daughter duo are wearing matching Halloween costumes. Both are all dressed in pink and sporting butterfly wings. Too cute!
And then, of course, there was this balloon-tastic moment from September 2018 which shows Jenner and Stormi surrounded by pink heart-shaped balloons:
Stormi wasn’t the only star of Jenner’s best nine. Her sister Kendall was also featured in a photo that was posted in October 2018. The photo shows both sisters in white tops looking at the camera.
“We used to dream about the day we’d be 21&amp;22.. time flies ✨,” the post was captioned.
Jenner’s boyfriend is also featured in Jenner’s best nine in a photo that shows the couple holding their daughter. It’s an adorable photo and one that definitely deserves its place among Jenner’s best nine for 2018.
All in all, it's been a great year for Jenner personally and on social media. Bring on 2019!","__label__Positive"
723,"Arsenal and Chelsea should pursue transfer as £60m star threatening to quit Man City","Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez is reportedly unsettled at the club after a difficult first season since his £60million transfer from Leicester City.

The Algeria international was a world class performer during his time at the King Power Stadium, winning the PFA Player of the Year prize in that memorable 2015/16 campaign in which he played a starring role guiding Leicester to a shock Premier League title win.

However, he hasn’t played as much in his time at Man City, and it now seems like his future at the Etihad Stadium could already be in serious doubt.

According to the Daily Mail , Mahrez has been openly complaining about a lack of first-team opportunities, with the headline of the piece suggesting he’s threatening to quit the club already.

If the 28-year-old does end up leaving City this summer, he could surely still earn himself a chance at another big club, and we think Arsenal and Chelsea make sense as possible destinations.

Eden Hazard has long been linked with a move to Real Madrid as he heads towards the final year of his contract at Stamford Bridge, and at his best, Mahrez is a similarly skilful talent capable of scoring and assisting in high numbers from that position.

Calciomercato recently linked Chelsea as being interested in Philippe Coutinho or Nicolas Pepe as potential Hazard replacements, but one imagines Mahrez could be a cheaper option, and he’d also have a point to prove after being overlooked by Pep Guardiola.

Of course, Chelsea may still face a transfer ban this summer, which would be a big stumbling block, but if they can get it delayed through appeal, they should go all out for this potential signing.

Arsenal, meanwhile, are being tipped by another report in the Mail to embark upon a mass clear-out this summer, which could see attacking players like Mesut Ozil and Henrikh Mkhitaryan offloaded.

2670,"Prepare for a war on balloons, environmental experts say","Now that plastic straws may be headed for extinction , could Americans’ love of balloons be deflated?
Has the US reached a breaking point when it comes...
The joyous celebration of releasing balloons into the air has long bothered environmentalists, who say the pieces that fall back to earth can be deadly to seabirds and turtles that eat them. So as companies vow to banish plastic straws, there are signs balloons will be among the products to get more scrutiny, even though they’re a very small part of environmental pollution.
This year, college football powerhouse Clemson University is ending its tradition of releasing 10,000 balloons into the air before games, a move that’s part of its sustainability efforts. In Virginia, a campaign that urges alternatives to balloon releases at weddings is expanding. And a town in Rhode Island outright banned the sale of all balloons earlier this year, citing the harm to marine life.
“There are all kinds of alternatives to balloons, a lot of ways to express yourself,” says Kenneth Lacoste, first warden of New Shoreham, Rhode Island, who cites posters, piñatas and decorated paper.
Following efforts to limit plastic bags, the push by environmentalists against straws has gained traction in recent months, partly because they’re seen as unnecessary for most. Companies including Starbucks and Disney are promising to phase out plastic straws , which can be difficult to recycle because of their size and often end up as trash in the ocean. A handful of U.S. cities recently passed or are considering bans. And the push may bring attention to other items people may not have considered — like festive balloons.
Starbucks, bending to growing environmental concerns, will eliminate plastic straws...
“The issue of straws has really broadened the marine debris issue,” says Emma Tonge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. People might not realize balloons are a danger, she says, because of their “light and whimsical” image.
Balloons are not among the top 10 kinds of debris found in coastal cleanups, but Tongue says they’re common and especially hazardous to marine animals, which can also get entangled in balloon strings.
Chelsea Rochman, an assistant professor of ecology at the University of Toronto, says people should think systemically about waste and pollution, but that efforts to bring attention to specific products shouldn’t be dismissed as too minor.
“If we said that about everything, we wouldn’t get anything done,” she says.
Already, a few states restrict balloon releases to some extent, according to the Balloon Council, which represents the industry and advocates for the responsible handling of its products to “uphold the integrity of the professional balloon community.” That means never releasing them into the air, and ensuring the strings have a weight tied to them so the balloons don’t accidentally float away.","__label__Neutral"

RBNZ came close to cutting rates in February: British economist
March 25 (BusinessDesk) - The Reserve Bank of New Zealand came close to cutting rates when it delivered last month’s monetary policy statement, according to UK-based economist Andrew Hunt.
The central bank knows New Zealand is exposed to the global slowdown, particularly to a slowdown in China, and New Zealand’s banks are dependent on offshore wholesale funding, Hunt told an investment conference in Wellington organised by Nikko Asset Management.
Concerns about liquidity in wholesale interest rate markets globally is one of the reasons the Reserve Bank is proposing to nearly double banks’ minimum tier 1 capital, to ready the banks to withstand a one-in-200 year catastrophe, Hunt says.
Since the GFC, the amount New Zealand banks need to borrow from offshore has fallen from about 40 percent of their assets to about 25 percent and has shifted from short-term borrowing to significantly longer terms.
Hunt says that since regulators in the United States and Japan have acted to stop banks from lending in emerging markets, the world has gone from a glut of credit to a shortage.
The world is already in a trade and industrial production recession as a result of that credit squeeze, he argues.
And Asian nations have returned to exporting deflation. Given about a third of US goods are manufactured in Asia, that’s likely to decrease inflation in the US by about 100 basis points and will offset the inflationary impact of rising wages in the US, Hunt says.
After the passage of President Donald Trump’s US$1.5 trillion tax package in late 2017, which included incentives for US companies to repatriate capital, only about a dozen US companies bothered to bring money back from offshore, he says.
The outcome of the mid-term US elections last November, which resulted in control of the House of Representatives shifting from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party, was a wake-up call for companies which hadn’t gotten around to repatriating capital. They realised the incentives might not always be available.
Within 10 days of those elections, US corporates repatriated US$220 billion, flooding US markets with cash during the government shutdown and until very recently, Hunt says.
With about US$750-800 billion of Treasuries set to be issued in April and May, there are questions about who will buy them, given three-month yields are now higher than on 10-year Treasuries, he says.
The three-month Treasury bills were quoted recently at 2.4527 percent while 10-year Treasury bonds were at 2.439 percent.
While the industrial sector in China was beset by a credit crunch through 2018, China’s households were saving less and spending more.
But now the wider economy in China is feeling a credit crunch and its economic growth is slowing. Hunt says growth is likely to drop to about 3 percent this year.
That would be down from 6.6 percent in 2018, which was already the slowest pace in 28 years.
Growth is also slowing in Japan and Europe and all this means the IMF forecast of 3 percent world growth in 2019 “is a joke,” Hunt says.
All these events have fed into the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s calculations and Hunt says the central bank will sacrifice the New Zealand dollar – by cutting interest rates – to ensure nominal GDP growth.
“If you’re a small, open economy, the easiest way to maintain GDP growth is through your currency – if your terms of trade remain quite consistent, it works very well,” he says.","__label__Neutral"
1628,"Blessing marks start of harbour-side cycleway","A blessing was held at Omanu Kai-kuru/Pt Jerningham this morning ahead of construction starting after Easter on the first part of the planned new two-way bike path around Evans Bay.

Associate Minister of Transport Julie Anne Genter and Wellington Mayor Justin Lester took part in the ceremony led by Taranaki Whānui, which marks the start of a two-year project to improve the coastal route.

The project will see the narrow on-road bike lanes around Evans Bay between Carlton Gore Road and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) replaced with a separate bike path suitable for all ages and abilities, as well as the development of more appealing areas for people on foot.

Over the next 10 months work will be happening at Pt Jerningham, where new sections of seawall will be installed on top of existing foundations, providing more space for people above.

Changes include an improved pedestrian route around the point with new seats, look-out points, better access down to the rocks, decorative lighting poles, bike parking, and the first 800m of the new traffic-free bike path. Work is expected to start the week after Easter.

The Mayor says he is delighted work will soon be under way.

“This is a key section of Tahitai, the commuter and recreational route from the east, which will be part of the future Te Aranui o Pōneke (the Great Harbour Way), and I’m sure will become a very popular feature of the city.

“When completed the 7-kilometre off-road stretch between Miramar and the city will be a tourism and recreation destination for all ages, and both Wellingtonians and tourists alike. I can see this becoming one of New Zealand’s most popular rides and a magnet for the city.”

The journey will be along the wider new paths being developed on Cobham Drive, the new Evans Bay bike path getting under way now, existing shared paths south of NIWA and in Oriental Bay, and the recently completed section of bike path near Freyberg Pool.

Councillor Sarah Free, portfolio leader for walking and cycling, says the plans have drawn on the expertise of engineers and urban designers to come up with something really special and unique for this coastal route, which is very popular with walkers, runners and cyclists of all ages and abilities.

“Electronic counters on the new section of pathway in Oriental Bay recorded 92,361 bike journeys in the first three months of this year, which shows just how well used this new route may be.”

NZ Transport Agency Portfolio Manager Sarah Downs says the Government is committed to encouraging more New Zealanders to choose active transport options, like cycling that reduce our carbon emissions and benefit our health.

“We know that Kiwis are looking for more efficient transport options that are good for them and for their communities. More people on bikes means less congestion in urban centres, reduced emissions, improved public health and, most importantly, more liveable cities.”

The $10 million project is part of the New Zealand Government Urban Cycleways Programme, and is being delivered by Wellington City Council in partnership with the NZ Transport Agency.

Councillors approved the project in March last year, following work by a community working group and public consultation. As detailed designs for sections east of Pt Jerningham are developed, there will be more discussions with local residents in some locations.

What to expect during construction: •         A 30km/h speed limit will be in place at all times in the vicinity of Pt Jerningham while the work happens.  •       Between 9am and 4pm, traffic will be down to one lane through the work zone most of the time. The work will involve a crane, diggers and trucks. Outside these hours, including at peak times, traffic lanes will normally operate in both directions. Temporary traffic lights will be installed.

•         It will take longer to travel through this area, particularly 9am to 4pm, so people will need to allow extra time or take another route. Weekend work is possible at times.

•         People will still be able to walk, run, bike and drive through this area at all times, but will need to take extra care.

•         The existing on-road bike lanes will be out of action where work is happening, so people on bikes will generally need to share the 30km/h section of road with other traffic.

1227,"Nancy Pelosi fights for Democratic support in bid to reclaim speaker's gavel","Published 2:49 PM EST Nov 20, 2018
WASHINGTON – Nancy Pelosi wants to be speaker of the House again, and she has eight days left to make her case.
Although Pelosi has said she’s confident she will win her bid, she’s been scrambling to shore up support – even among Democratic groups that have long backed her.
In recent weeks, she spoke to a room of Hispanic lawmakers, hosted a dinner for new Democratic members and joined African-American lawmakers addressing a conference of black activists.
Still, Pelosi, who made history as the first female speaker of the House, is facing an open rebellion from a bloc of 16 Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter calling for a change in the “status quo” of the party’s leadership. And at least one Democrat – Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus – is mulling a challenge for the top spot.
Pelosi is courting groups as diverse as the Congressional Black Caucus, comprised mostly of progressive members, and the Problem Solvers Caucus, a group of 48 centrists.
She has also met with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Blue Dog Coalition, the New Democrat Coalition and the Progressive Caucus.
More: On her first day of orientation on Capitol Hill, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez protests in Pelosi's office
""This is the moment to leverage the agenda,"" said Wendy Smooth, associate professor of Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies at the Ohio State University. “She will get a strong message from her caucuses about the ways they would like the agenda shaped. It depends on what she’s promising in these meetings.""
Smooth said committee assignments and leadership roles are on the table.
The caucuses, some with varying missions, have lengthy wish lists from more action on climate control to protecting voting rights to immigration reforms and changing rules to speed up bipartisan legislation.
Pelosi met with several groups, including the Problem Solvers Caucus, last week.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, co-chair of the caucus, said the meeting was productive and was followed up Monday with a call with Pelosi staffers to discuss the group’s “Break the Gridlock” reform package. The proposal aims to encourage bipartisan cooperation. Nine Democrats from the caucus signed a letter calling for Pelosi’s support.
Pelosi sent a statement last week backing the package in principle, but Gottheimer said the language was specific enough.
“I’ve been pretty clear and a group of us have – we’re only going to back someone who is going to break the gridlock,” Gottheimer said.
Pelosi, who served as speaker from 2007 to 2011, is expected to win the first-round of voting next Wednesday in the Democratic caucus’ closed-door secret election. She only needs a majority to win the nomination. But to become speaker, she will need a majority of the full House – 218 votes – and has little room to lose a significant bloc of Democrats.
Pelosi has pledged to make voting rights – one of the ""unifying issues"" for the Democrats, according to Smooth – a priority and one of the first measures the House will vote on next session.
And in a nod to one of the most diverse Congresses ever, Pelosi has also touted a proposal to expand a diversity initiative in the chamber and is discussing a possible panel on climate change.
Supporters point to Pelosi’s legislative experience and ability to corral Democrats on issues and note her big role in the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Many Democrats campaigned on the issue in the midterms.
Some experts said it might not sit well if Pelosi isn't in the top post, especially at a time when a record number of women have been elected to the House, many of them Democrats.
But it will still be a battle.
“As all women leaders know, it is never the last fight,"" Smooth said. ""Pelosi is a skilled politician and a skilled woman in politics, so she knows this is only the fight until the next one.”
Jack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in California, said the letter signed by the 16 Democrats “complicates things. If all 16 signers hold together and vote against her in the official vote, she’s got a problem.”
Pitney said the next speaker must be ready to take on Trump and wrestle with the Republican-controlled Senate led by Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
“Trump is going to press very hard,"" Pitney said. “McConnell is a very formidable opponent, and for somebody without any experience, it’s like a touch football player suiting up against the NFL.""

Jeff Van Drew, a newly elected Democrat from New Jersey, said he promised during the campaign he wouldn’t back Pelosi. 
""Not that I have any personal dislike for her, or she didn't do a good job in her time,'' said Van Drew, who was among the Democrats who signed the letter. ""But sometimes it's good to have a fresh new face and to have change and go forward with some new ideas.""
Virginia's Rep.-elect Abigail Spanberger, one of the record number of women who will serve in the next Congress, said ""under no circumstances"" will she vote for Pelosi.
“It is something that came up frequently on the campaign trail, particularly for our middle-of-the-road voters,” Spanberger said. “I think she is an incredibly strong person, I think that she’s done incredibly good things. But also my background is CIA. You never held a job at CIA longer than three years.”
 Several longtime members have pledged support, saying Pelosi has paid her dues and has played a key role in helping Democrats regain control of the House.
“Nancy Pelosi’s not worried,’’ said Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who is in line to chair the Finance Committee. “Nancy Pelosi said we were going to win. And when people doubted her, she said we’re going to win, and guess what? She was right. Nancy Pelosi said she’s going to be the speaker. I believe Nancy Pelosi is right.”
Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, who said he and Pelosi came to Congress around the same time, said many newer members haven’t worked with her and don’t know her as well.
“She’s been a good leader, and I’m supporting her,” said Lewis, a civil rights icon. “I think we need her leadership, her energy, her strength now more than ever before, and I don’t have any doubt that she would be re-elected as  speaker.”

Meanwhile, other Democratic groups are lining up to lobby for issues they want party leaders to support.
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has made immigration a priority after what Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro called two years of ""unrelenting attacks against the Latino community.""
And the Congressional Black Caucus has put voting rights and criminal justice reform at the top of its agenda.
Beyond meeting with Democratic groups, Pelosi also met with Fudge as the Ohioan weighs a run for speaker. Some Democrats have publicly backed Fudge.
“Congress needs a new leader. Period,"" Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., tweeted.  “I’m hoping Marcia Fudge, my first (and arguably best) mentor in Congress will run for the next speaker of the House. I have full faith in her ability to lead our new Congress to its fullest potential.”
She said Fudge, who has been a vocal advocate of measures to strengthen voting rights, may be using her potential bid as leverage, too.

2636,"U.S. regulators approve most expensive medicine ever: $2.1 million to treat fatal disease in babies - CBS News","The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved the treatment, called Zolgensma, for all children under age 2 who are confirmed by a genetic test to have any of the four types of the disease. The therapy is a one-time infusion that takes about an hour.
Novartis said it will let insurers make payments over five years, at $425,000 per year, and will give partial rebates if the treatment doesn't work.
The one other medicine for the disease approved in the U.S. is a drug called Spinraza. Instead of a one-time treatment, it must be given every four months. Biogen, Spinraza's maker, charges a list price of $750,000 for the first year and then $350,000 per year after that.
The independent nonprofit group Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which rates the value of expensive new medicines, calculated that the price of the new gene therapy is justifiable at a cost of $1.2 million to $2.1 million because it ""dramatically transforms the lives of families affected by this devastating disease.""
The defective gene that causes spinal muscular atrophy prevents the body from making enough of a protein that allows nerves that control movement to work normally. The nerves die off without the protein.
In the most common type, which is also the most severe, at least 90% of patients die by age 2, and any still alive need a ventilator to breathe. Children with less-severe types become disabled more slowly and can live for up to a couple decades.
Zolgensma works by supplying a healthy copy of the faulty gene, which allows nerve cells to then start producing the needed protein. That halts deterioration of the nerve cells and allows the baby to develop more normally.
In patient testing, babies with the most severe form of the disease who got Zolgensma within 6 months of birth had limited muscle problems. Those who got the treatment earliest did best.
Babies given Zolgensma after six months stopped losing muscle control, but the medicine can't reverse damage already done.
Evelyn Villarreal was one of the first children treated, at eight weeks. Her family, from Centreville, Virginia, had lost their first child to spinal muscular atrophy at 15 months. Two years later when Evelyn was born a test showed she also had the disease, so the family enrolled her in the gene therapy study at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.
Evelyn is now 4½ years old and showing no muscle problems other than minor trouble standing up, said her mother, Elena Villarreal. She has been feeding herself for a long time, she draws and speaks well, and will be starting kindergarten in the fall.
""She's very active and goes to the playground a lot,"" said Elena Villarreal. ""She's walking and even jumping.""
It is too early to know how long the benefit of the treatment lasts, but doctors' hopes are rising that they could last a lifetime, according to Dr. Jerry Mendell, a neurologist at Nationwide Children's. Mendell led one of the early patient studies and is Evelyn's doctor.
""It's beginning to look that way,"" he said, because a few children treated who are now 4 or 5 still have no symptoms.
Early diagnosis is crucial, so Novartis has been working with states to get genetic testing for newborns required at birth. It expects most states will have that requirement by next year.
The FDA said side effects included vomiting and potential liver damage, so patients must be monitored for the first few months after treatment.

684,"Justice Department investigates fake net neutrality comments","The FBI is reportedly helping look into activity on the FCC's website.

The scrutiny over fake net neutrality comments appears to be intensifying. Sources talking to BuzzFeed News said the Justice Department is investigating whether or not there were crimes when people posted millions of bogus comments on the FCC's net neutrality repeal, stealing many people's identities in the process. The FBI reportedly subpoenaed at least two organizations for information ""a few days"" after New York state did for its own investigation , according to the insiders.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has acknowledged that about 500,000 of the comments were tied to Russian email addresses , but the agency under his leadership has so far refused Freedom of Information Act requests for server logs that could help reveal the people responsible for the fake comments. The FCC claimed that the data could expose the US to cyberattacks, but Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel argued that the regulator is merely trying to ""hide"" behind FOIA exemptions.

More than half of the nearly 22 million comments were fake , according to one study, and only 17.4 percent were unique. Many of them repeated the same pro-repeal messages almost verbatim, and many of them used fake email addresses from a handful of domains. On top of what looks to be Russian meddling, there are concerns that telecoms or anti-regulation groups may have flooded the comments with fake grassroots support to make it seem as if the public was on their side. Most of the genuine comments opposed the repeal.

1604,"Is It Safe to Face Your Trauma?","Is It Safe to Face Your Trauma?

It is estimated that 50 - 70% of adults in the United States have experienced at least one traumatic event in their lifetime [i] [ii]. Approximately 15% of these people will go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder , which can be a serious and sometimes disabling illness [iii]. In any given year, about 3.6% of the US population suffers from PTSD [iv]. Symptoms can include recurrent memories of the traumatic event(s), nightmares, trying to avoid things associated with the trauma, feelings of detachment or depression , sleep disturbances, and being easily startled. Sadly, PTSD often goes unrecognized. Only about 50% of people with the disorder are getting treatment [v], and even the people who do get treatment often don't get appropriate treatment for PTSD - instead, they get treatment for depression, anxiety , and other disorders, and the trauma history goes unrecognized.

Many people with a trauma history don't want to talk about it. They get intrusive thoughts and nightmares about the trauma, and they want them to stop. They are afraid that talking about it will only make it worse. Sometimes, they’re afraid that talking about it will only make them lose control of their emotions - start crying or get angry in front of someone - so they avoid the topic. They are trying desperately to put it in the past and keep it there, but they just don’t know how to do that.

Sometimes being traumatized takes a toll on a person’s self-esteem , and some victims of abuse or trauma engage in dangerous behaviors. Suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts can be common among trauma survivors, and some engage in purposeful self-injury - things like cutting or burning themselves in order to relieve emotional pain. This can be especially common in those who were abused as children. Alcohol and drug abuse can also be common in trauma survivors, with estimates of 50-66% of people with PTSD having problems with addiction [vi]. Some speculate that this is a way to numb the pain, but nonetheless, it ends up posing risks to the person’s health and safety. 

Up until recently, a paradigm for working with trauma survivors was “safety first,” meaning that  survivors had to be able to refrain from reckless use of alcohol and drugs and refrain from suicide attempts and self-injury before they were allowed to deal with the trauma. There is no question that talking about trauma is stressful. The concern was that facing the trauma - talking about it, or doing the evidence-based work of Prolonged Exposure Therapy for PTSD - would  make the suicidality or substance abuse even worse.

Clinicians didn’t want to harm their patients. “Seal, don’t peel” was a common phrase heard on the specialty PTSD unit in which I worked years ago. It meant focus on functioning and safety in the here and now and “seal” in those memories—don’t “peel” away the outer defenses and allow them to come out. This all made sense at the time, and it’s still a paradigm practiced by many clinicians to this day.

The problem is that some people never got to the point of being safe enough to talk about the trauma, and so it never got talked about. Victims were told over and over that it wasn’t safe to talk about until they could maintain their safety. But this risked sending another kind of message: “You’re not strong enough to talk about it.” “The trauma is too powerful and awful for you to deal with.” Many of these people still aren’t better to this day. They need to face their trauma.

Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy exposes people to their traumatic memories over and over again until those memories begin to lose their power, and simply become memories of bad things that happened, as opposed to overwhelming thoughts and feelings that victims often try to avoid. This treatment can be done is as few as 6-12 sessions. The therapist guides the client to talk about details of the traumatic event(s), and this part of the session is often recorded. The therapist also teaches skills that will allow the client to remain safe and present in his/her environment . The client is then asked to listen to the recording over and over again until the next session, in order to decrease, or extinguish, the fear response that the memories trigger.

Research by Denise Hien and colleagues shows that people with PTSD and active substance abuse can engage in prolonged exposure therapy for PTSD and get better, without increasing their use of substances. [vii] Not only was combination treatment for both PTSD and substance use just as safe as substance use treatment alone, but the PTSD symptoms improved much more in the combined treatment group.

Martin Bohus in Germany is working with women who are diagnosed with both borderline personality disorder (BPD) and PTSD who are frequently engaging in suicidal acts or self injury. He did a study of 74 women and assigned half of them to a residential treatment unit where they received DBT for PTSD, a combination treatment of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)—commonly used for BPD—and exposure therapy for their PTSD. The other half received treatment as usual. [viii] He did not exclude women who were actively self-harming. At the end of the study, women who received the PTSD treatment had significantly more improvement in their PTSD symptoms than the control group, and they did not show an increase in self-harming behaviors.

Bohus shared some of the women’s reflections that after years of running from traumatic memories, finally confronting them brought much relief.  Some remarked that they wished they had been offered this treatment years earlier, because they suffered unnecessarily for all of those years and can’t get them back now.

906,"Marvel is developing a Falcon-Winter Soldier TV series","It will apparently be part of Disney's upcoming streaming service.

It's no secret that Disney is developing several shows for its upcoming streaming service. The House of Mouse has already confirmed Jon Favreau's Star Wars show about a lone space gunfighter called The Mandalorian . And previous reports say it's working on standalone shows that revolve around Loki and Scarlet Witch, as well. Now, according to a new report by Variety , the company is also putting Falcon and Winter Soldier together in a limited TV series written by Empire writer and producer Malcolm Spellman.

As Slashfilm notes, fans started clamoring for a Falcon-Winter Soldier spin off after seeing their rapport on the big screen in Captain America: Civil War. Their actors, Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan, said they're both open to the idea -- Stan visualizes their team-up to be something like a buddy comedy from the '80s or '90s. Disney didn't confirm Variety's report, so it's hard to say if that's what we're truly getting and if it has even greenlit the show's development.

All we know is that the live-action titles Disney is developing for its streaming service will be high-budget shows not unlike the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney's streaming service is expected to launch in 2019, so we'll definitely hear more about the shows it's developing for it in the near future.","__label__Neutral"

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan said it was seeking to block former chairman Carlos Ghosn’s access to an apartment in Rio de Janeiro, citing a risk that the executive, arrested and removed from his role for financial misconduct, may remove or destroy evidence.
Brazilian-born Ghosn has been detained in Tokyo since his Nov. 19 arrest on suspicion of conspiring with former Nissan Representative Director Greg Kelly to understate his compensation by about half of the actual 10 billion yen ($88 million), over five years from 2010.
Tokyo authorities extended their detention until the maximum Dec. 10 for the alleged crime.
A Brazil court has granted Ghosn access to the property, owned by Nissan, in the Copacabana neighborhood, but the company said in a statement on Sunday that it was now petitioning a higher court to reverse the decision.
“Nissan has been cooperating with authorities to investigate misconduct on the part of its former chairman, and is working to prevent the destruction of any potential evidence that could occur by allowing access to residences in question,” a Nissan spokesman said.
A person close to the Tokyo prosecutors’ office told Reuters that Ghosn, Kelly and Nissan itself will be indicted as early as Monday.
“Nissan identified serious misconduct related to the reporting of Mr. Ghosn’s compensation. The company has been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and has been fully cooperating with its investigation. We will continue to do so,” the Nissan spokesman said.

553,"Pete Buttigieg’s message to France sends social media into a tizzy","Just when you thought presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg’s list of talents couldn’t get any longer.

The 37-year-old Indiana mayor — a graduate of Harvard and Oxford universities, Rhodes Scholar, Afghanistan veteran and musician — sent social media ablaze Monday night when he delivered a touching message to the people of France in the wake of the Notre Dame blaze — in fluent French.

English and French are just two of seven languages that Buttigieg speaks.

“To the people of France, I would like to say that Notre Dame Cathedral was like a gift to the human species,” the Democrat told a reporter from the French station BFM TV at a fundraiser in Williamsburg, New York.

Video of his message went viral as social-media users fawned over his talents and hailed the mayor of South Bend as the next president.

By Tuesday afternoon, the clip had 3.3 million views.

“I’m crushing pretty hard on #PeteButtigieg2020 right now,” one Twitter user wrote less than a day after Buttigieg announced his candidacy for president.

Quipped one fan : “Why is there even an election for goodness sake. Just give him the damn job and I’m Canadian.”

“The View” co-host Ana Navarro-Cardenas added , “Today, I saw a video clip of @PeteButtigieg playing classical piano. Another were (sic) he speaks in Spanish. And this one, were (sic) he tells Parisians, he shares their pain — in French. Just imagine having a President whose intellect exceeds that of a root vegetable … for a change.”

While Buttigieg is enjoying his time in the sun, a Emerson poll released Monday put him in third place in a national poll of 2020 contenders, behind Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, respectively.

Buttigieg is a devout Christian who is openly gay and married partner Chasten Glezman last year.","__label__Positive"

857,"5 detained in Christmas market attack in France","French authorities detained five people as they hunted Wednesday for a suspected extremist who sprayed gunfire at one of Europe’s most famous Christmas markets in the eastern city of Strasbourg.

Meanwhile, medical officials lowered the death toll from Tuesday night’s attack from three to two, and then raised it back to three again. It was not immediately clear why the figures were changed. Thirteen people were wounded.

The government raised the security alert level and sent police reinforcements to Strasbourg, where some 350 security forces are searching for the assailant. Police officials said he was wounded in a gunfight with soldiers after the shooting attack but escaped, and a top official said he might have escaped to neighboring Germany.

The suspected attacker is Cherif Chekatt, 29, with a police record in France and Germany who had been flagged for extremism, police said. Police detained five people in overnight searches around the city, Laurent Nunez, secretary of state for the Interior Ministry, said on France-Inter radio.","__label__Neutral"
2266,"Sixers besting Raptors in battle of bench minutes - NBA.com","Toronto's lineup has lost some of its punch when starters like Marc Gasol and Kawhi Leonard check out.

Reserve Greg Monroe didn't hamper the Sixers' offense when paired with the starters.

In the battle of the two most dominant lineups of the first round, the Raptors' starting lineup has outplayed the Sixers' starting lineup.

The Raptors' lineup -- Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Pascal Siakam and Marc Gasol -- has outscored the Sixers by 25.1 points per 100 possessions in its 51 minutes. In 25 minutes with both starting lineups on the floor, the score has been Raptors 63, Sixers 46. Plus, those starters-vs.-starters minutes were even better for the Raptors in Game 2 ( 33-21 ) than they were in Game 1 ( 30-25 ).

The 29.6 total minutes that the Raptors' starters played in Game 2 were the most minutes (by a pretty wide margin) that any lineup has played in any game in these playoffs. The only other lineup that has played more than 25 minutes in a game was the Portland starters ( 25.8 ) in Game 3 in Oklahoma City. The Raptors were a plus-13 in those 29.6 minutes, which means that they were outscored by 18 points in 18.4 minutes with at least one their reserves on the floor.

How can the Sixers take a 2-1 series lead in Game 3?

(Random note when talking about how many minutes lineups have played in individual games: There have been 49 games in these playoffs through Wednesday and none of them have gone to overtime. Last year, four of 82 playoff games went to OT.)

Some of that damage came against the Philadelphia starters. In 5.4 minutes with the Sixers' starting lineup on the floor against Toronto lineups that included at least one reserve, Philly outscored Toronto by seven points (12-5).

But most of the damage came with reserves on the floor for both teams. In 13 minutes with at least one reserve on the floor for both Toronto and Philly, the Sixers outscored the Raptors by 11 points (31-20).

The score of those reserves-on-the-floor-for-both-teams minutes in Game 1? Raptors 31, Sixers 20. Same score, different result.

One difference in those minutes was that Sixers coach Brett Brown shortened his rotation and limited the time in which he had just one or two starters on the floor. In Game 1 (not counting garbage time), the Sixers were a minus-9 in 5.6 minutes with fewer than three starters on the floor. In Game 2, they were a minus-5 in just 1.4 minutes with fewer than three starters on the floor.

Brown took Furkan Korkmaz out of the rotation, extended Ben Simmons' minutes ( from less than 34 in Game 1 to more than 44 in Game 2 ) and barely played a mostly-reserve unit that included James Ennis, Jonah Bolden and Boban Marjanovic. In 177 career games, the only time that Simmons has played more was the Sixers' triple-overtime game against Oklahoma City last season.

Of course, the Sixers also just had better results in their hybrid lineups. In Game 1, the Sixers' lineups with three or four starters on the floor were a minus-14 in 18.7 minutes. In Game 2, they were a plus-15 in 26.8 minutes.

One matchup the Raptors may want to avoid? Serge Ibaka vs. Joel Embiid. Even though Embiid has shot just 7-for-25 in the series, the Sixers have outscored the Raptors by 28 points in 26 minutes when he's been on the floor against Ibaka. The Raptors got away with a minus-14 in 13 of those minutes in Game 1 , but not again in Game 2 .

The Raptors rank second in ball movement in the playoffs.

As noted after Game 2, the difference between the Raptors win and the Sixers' win was on Toronto's end of the floor . The Sixers have scored a little less than a point per possession in each game. In Game 1, the Raptors scored 108 points on 98 possessions. But in Game 2, they were held to just 89 on 95, their fourth-worst offensive performance in 89 total games this season.

Interestingly, one of the biggest differences in the Toronto offense between Games 1 and 2 was ball movement. But the problem in Game 2 wasn't that the ball didn't move as much as it did in Game 1. It actually moved a lot more. Even though they had three fewer possessions on Monday, the Raptors passed the ball 67 more times than they did two nights earlier.

The Raptors rank second in ball movement in the playoffs (352 passes per 24 minutes of possession), the only team that has averaged more passes per 24 than it did in the regular season. The other 15 playoff teams have averaged 30 fewer passes per 24 minutes of possession than they did in the regular season. The Raptors have averaged seven more.

But Toronto has been more efficient when it hasn't moved the ball as much. In their four playoff games in which they've passed the ball fewer than 350 times per 24 minutes of possession, the Raptors have scored 112.5 points per 100 possessions. In their three games in which they've passed the ball more than 350 times per 24, they've scored just 104.1 points per 100 possessions.

The Starters discuss which team is the best one left in the East playoffs.

Part of that is that Kawhi Leonard has been the postseason's most efficient scorer on isolations and its fourth-most efficient scorer on pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions . He has an effective field goal percentage of 62.1 percent on pull-up jumpers, the second-best mark among players who have attempted at least 25.

In Game 1, Leonard was 8-for-12 (2-for-5 from 3-point range) on pull-up jumpers. In Game 2 he was 5-for-12 (1-for-6).

In Game 1, Leonard had 55 touches and passed the ball just 19 times . In Game 2, he had 68 touches , but passed it 38 times . The Sixers, with Simmons guarding him most of the time, did a better job of getting the ball out of Leonard's hands.

JJ Redick has been a solid perimeter defender for the Sixers in the playoffs.

One reason that getting the ball out of Leonard's hands has worked is that Green has shot 2-for-10 from 3-point range. Green missed two 3-point attempts that would have tied Game 2 in the final 1:01 of the fourth quarter.

The second of those was open, because Jimmy Butler rotated over to Leonard after Lowry recovered his own failed attempt at a nutmeg. The first was somewhat contested by J.J. Redick.

Redick has been the primary defender on Green, as he was on Joe Harris in the first round. Harris (47.4 percent) was the league's leading 3-point shooter in the regular season and Green (45.5 percent) ranked second.

Combined, Harris ( 4-for-21 ) and Green have shot 19 percent from 3-point range against the Sixers in these playoffs. On possessions in which Redick has been their defender, they're 0-for-9 from beyond the arc , having shot less often than they usually do, per Second Spectrum tracking.

Redick is one of the best in the league at moving without the ball to get open. While he can be picked on defensively in isolations or pick-and-rolls, he's done a great job off the ball of keeping his fellow shooters from getting open.

1423,"SkyCity expects core annual net profit to fall on tax charge","May 1 (BusinessDesk) - SkyCity Entertainment Group lowered its full-year guidance slightly after year-to-date trading was softer than expected and after the earlier settlement of the Darwin casino sale.
The casino operator now expects its normalised earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year ending June 30 to be flat on the previous year. This contrasts with a prior forecast for 5 percent growth when it announced its first half result in February.  That earlier forecast was based on the A$188 million sale of its Darwin casino to US hospitality company Delaware North settling on June 30. The sale, however, was completed on April 4.
Sky also said it expects its group normalised net profit to be slightly below the prior year, rather than slightly above, as it had forecast previously. This reflects an increase in the effective tax rate that will have a $6 million impact, it said.
In the year-to-date to April 28 it said its group normalised revenue was up 4 percent on the same period a year earlier while domestic revenue, excluding its international business, was flat. The group reported revenue was down 2 percent on the same period due to a low international business win rate.
Regarding its different markets, it said year-to-date revenue was slightly higher in Auckland and stable in Hamilton. In Australia, it pointed to weaker revenue performance in Adelaide due to increased disruption from construction works. Performance in the now sold Darwin casino was slightly below expectations due to ongoing challenging conditions.
In its international business, it still expects to achieve turnover of around $13 billion to $14 billion in the full year.
The stock closed yesterday at $4.08 and has fallen 34 percent so far this year.","__label__Neutral"
1300,"Has Shane Jones been doing a Justin Trudeau?","Has Shane Jones been doing a Justin Trudeau?
NZ First’s Shane Jones has stepped into the middle of legal action between the NZ Transport Agency and Northland’s biggest logging transport operator, even though he holds the portfolio of Associate Transport Minister.
Jones said he was speaking as the Regional Economic Development Minister when he expressed concern to the Herald about a case between the NZ Transport Agency and Semenoff Logging.
“I’m concerned about the economic implications flowing from issues between NZTA and Semenoff Logging,” Jones said, following a High Court decision last Monday where the transporter  won  temporary suspension of a ban on its licence.
On March 15, NZTA revoked Semenoff’s transport services licence over a range of safety issues, due to take effect on March 22.
This is entirely inappropriate. No Minister should be commenting on independent prosecution or regulatory safety decisions. Even worse Jones is an Associate Transport Minister so his public statements can only be seen as public pressure on an agency he has some ministerial responsibility for.
“I’m concerned about the future of 1000 jobs in Northland which could be on the line due to the High Court case. The High Court case doesn’t prohibit the first citizen of the provinces from advocating on behalf of economic development.
You’re not the effing first citizen of anything. You’re the Associate Minister of Transport attacking a decision by NZTA made on safety grounds.
The argument about being concerned about jobs is the exact one Justin Trudeau made when he tried to pressure the Canadian attorney-General not to prosecute a company that was a major employer in Trudeau’s home province.
Meredith Connell managing partner Steve Haszard, who has been overseeing NZTA’s regulatory compliance, said the entity has been strongly encouraging Stan Semenoff Logging since 2016 to get the company to lift its safety standards.
“The Transport Agency has given Stan Semenoff Logging every opportunity to provide evidence of improvement, but over the course of two audits and three years we have seen that this company is either unwilling or unable to comply with the necessary transport operator safety standards,” Haszard said.
“The revocation is a safety decision, plain and simple. It’s not just about the safety of Mr Semenoff’s drivers, it’s about the safety of all Northland’s other road users,” he said.
“As with every revocation we enforce, we know this will have an impact on those people employed by the company, and that is why we have made every effort to extensively engage with Mr Semenoff to avoid getting to this point.”
In August 2018, the agency served a notice of proposal to Stan Semenoff in a final effort to get him to provide evidence he was now complying with the required safety standards, he said.
“It was ultimately up to Stan Semenoff Logging to avoid this situation by demonstrating safety improvement. We were given many assurances from his company that standards would be lifted, but in the end, they weren’t,” Haszard says.
The Government says it wants safer roads yet their Associate Transport Minister is attacking a regulatory decision to do just that.
If all Jones has done is mouth off to the media, then the PM can get away with (another) public reprimand and instruction not to do it again.
However if Jones has had discussions with any officials or contractors of NZTA regarding the decision, then he must be sacked. If he has privately tried to pressure NZTA with regards to an independent safety regulatory decision, just because it involves a major employer in a seat he wants to win – he must go.","__label__Negative"

310,"Another man says he was blinded by exploding Corona bottle","A barback at a trendy Manhattan watering hole was left...
Another New Yorker plans to sue beer-making giant Corona over claims he was left partially blinded by an exploding bottle.
Lachtman Ramnanan, 57, a Queens construction worker, said the warm brew “just blew up” as he put it into an ice cooler this past Father’s Day — and glass shot into his left eye.
“I needed emergency surgery,” Ramnanan — who said he underwent two surgical repairs of his eyeball but has only regained 20 percent of his vision so far — told The Post on Sunday.
Ramnanan said he contacted Long Island lawyer John Dazi last week after reading a Post article about Dazi’s first allegedly blinded-by-a-Corona bottle client , Gonzalo Luis-Morales.
Luis-Morales, 31, was working at the Frying Pan on Pier 66 in July 2017 when he said a bottle of Corona Extra spontaneously exploded, projecting a piece of glass into his left eye.
“I was making the buckets, and I put the first four beers in,’’ and then the next one exploded.
“That’s all I remember. I was in shock. I couldn’t move,’’ he said. “I was screaming at the bartender, asking her to move me out. There was so much pain.”
Luis-Morales says he is now blind in that eye and has been out of work since the incident.
Ramnanan said his accident happened when a friend brought over a six-pack of Corona, purchased at a convenience store in South Ozone Park.
Ramnanan said the family wanted to toast his daughter finishing her junior year at Baruch College and getting hired as a summer internship at a bank.
“The first bottle I took out and laid in the cooler,” he recalled.
“I heard a loud pop and something hit me in the face. It blew up.”
He said the next thing he knew, his wife was dragging him to the emergency room, where doctors sutured his eyeball with nine stitches.
He has been back to the eye doctor a half a dozen times for more procedures, he said, but so far, his vision hasn’t fully returned.
After realizing he would have lingering eye problems and may never work again, Ramnanan said he called Dazi.
Michael McGrew, a rep with Corona brewer Constellation Brands Inc. said the beer maker is investigating the matter.
“We take matters related to the safety, health and well-being of our consumers very seriously,” he said.","__label__Negative"
2333,"Kevin Spacey's Attorneys Go After Accuser's Anonymity","In September 2018, a massage therapist filed a lawsuit against Kevin Spacey for allegedly assaulting him at Spacey’s Malibu home in 2016. According to the complaint, the massage therapist, who chose to remain anonymous, entered Spacey’s home to massage him. The massage therapist said the actor forced the his hand to rub his genitals, twice, and at one point, Spacey allegedly stood up, tried to kiss him and offered to perform oral sex on him before he was able to leave the room.  On Thursday, Deadline reports, Spacey’s attorneys asked the lawsuit be dismissed. They also filed a court brief arguing against the victim’s anonymity, suggesting the case against Space would be “severely prejudiced” against him, and that doing so would render Spacey “more vulnerable to other threats and privacy invasions.” According to the Hollywood Reporter, Spacey’s attorneys believe the accuser’s anonymity “violates the longstanding requirement of judicial proceedings being open to the public, and multiple Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including the requirement that the Complaint identify the names of the parties and that a case be litigated by the real party in interest,” and “prevents possible unknown third parties with information about Plaintiff and his factual allegations from coming forward with information relevant to Mr. Fowler’s [Spacey’s legal name] defense.” Last month, Spacey was arraigned on a felony charge of indecent assault and battery on an 18-year-old busboy at a Nantucket bar and will re-enter court on March 4. He is also currently under investigation in London for multiple sexual misconduct allegations.","__label__Negative"
1496,"Labour Party Leader, Under Pressure, Backs a New Brexit Referendum - The New York Times","LONDON — Britain’s opposition Labour Party said on Monday that it was prepared to support a second referendum on withdrawal from the European Union, a shift that could have significant ramifications for the fate of Brexit and for the country’s future.

After the resignations of nine Labour Party members last week, and amid the prospect of more, the party’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, dropped his longstanding resistance to a second vote on leaving the bloc.

Getting an amendment for a new vote through Parliament any time soon is unlikely, but Mr. Corbyn’s support for one will cheer pro-European Britons, who have been fighting to reverse the outcome of the 2016 referendum decision. Without the support of Labour, there is no chance of a second referendum ever being authorized by lawmakers.

Though lacking in detail, Labour’s announcement suggested that, under pressure from many of his own lawmakers and party members, Mr. Corbyn, who is a lifelong critic of the European Union, will ultimately fall into line with those who support a so-called people’s vote.

The move carries considerable risks, as a sizable minority of traditional Labour districts, particularly in the country’s hard-pressed north, voted strongly to leave the European Union in the first referendum.

But one of the reasons cited by the Labour rebels who quit last week to join an independent grouping was Mr. Corbyn’s failure to oppose Brexit strongly enough.

Britain is scheduled to leave the European Union on March 29, but so far there is no agreement in Parliament on how to proceed. An exit deal negotiated by Mrs. May, the prime minister, was rejected by an overwhelming 230-vote margin last month.

If there is no agreement, the country risks a disorderly and possibly chaotic “no-deal exit” from the bloc.","__label__Neutral"
722,"Karl Lagerfeld, fashion’s prolific commander-in-chief, dies at 85","PARIS - Karl Lagerfeld enjoyed the stature of a god among mortals in the world of fashion, where he stayed on top for well over half of a century and up to his death, at an age almost nobody apart from himself knew with to-the-day precision.

He died at the age of 85, his fashion label Chanel announced Tuesday.

The German designer was best known for his association with the French fashion giant, dating back to 1983. The brand, the legend now goes, risked becoming the preserve of monied grannies before he arrived, slashing hemlines and adding glitz to the prim tweed suits of what is now one of the world’s most valuable couture houses.

But Lagerfeld, who simultaneously churned out collections for LVMH’s Fendi and his eponymous label — an unheard of feat in fashion — was almost a brand in his own right.

Sporting dark suits, white, pony-tailed hair and tinted sunglasses in his later years that made him instantly recognizable, an irreverent wit was also part of a carefully crafted persona.

“I am like a caricature of myself, and I like that,” runs one legendary quote attributed to him, and often recycled to convey the person he liked to play. “It is like a mask. And for me the Carnival of Venice lasts all year long.”

His artistic instincts, business acumen and commensurate ego combined to commercially triumphant effect in the rarefied world of high fashion, where he was revered and feared in similar proportions by competitors and top-models.

A refusal to look to the past was one of his biggest assets, those who knew him said.

The designer mingled with the young and trendy until the last, pairing up with 17-year-old catwalk darling Kaia Gerber, daughter of Cindy Crawford, for a collaboration released by his Karl Lagerfeld brand in 2018.

His cat Choupette moved with the times too: the white-haired Birman, described by her social network minders as “daughter of Karl Otto Lagerfeld,” has more than 100,000 Instagram followers and a publishing deal.

Yet Lagerfeld also stood out as a craftsman. An accomplished photographer, he drew his own designs by hand, an increasingly rare phenomenon in fashion. Behind the facade, he was known for his erudition and penchant for literature, and he devoured the world’s leading newspapers daily.

Though he long enjoyed befuddling interviewers by citing different years of birth, the one deemed the most reliable is Sept. 10, 1933.

Lagerfeld — dubbed “Kaiser Karl” and “Fashion Meister” among a whole host of media monikers — was born in Hamburg to a German mother and a Swedish father who imported condensed milk.

He spent his early childhood tucked away from war in the 1,200-acre family estate in Bavaria and had a French tutor.

The big breakthrough came shortly after a move to Paris when, in 1954, he drew a wool coat that won a prize and landed him an apprenticeship with designer Pierre Balmain.

Yves Saint Laurent, who went on to found his namesake label, won the dress prize. The two became fierce competitors and even rivals in love at one point, chasing the affections of late Parisian society figure Jacques de Bascher.

Saint Laurent, who died in 2008, became the enfant cheri of high society and Lagerfeld leader of a wild-child younger group.

He first found real success in the mid-1960s with Chloe, the fashion label now owned by Switzerland’s Richemont and to which he was connected off and on until 1997.

But it was Chanel that propelled him to rock-star status, as he sexed up the brand and lifted its profile with grandiose runway shows. In the past year these have featured a full-scale beach and an enormous replica ship.

He fired his closest female friend, former Chanel model Ines de la Fressange, in 1999 after she agreed to pose as Marianne, France’s national symbol, without asking him first.

Occasionally his sharp tongue has stirred controversies, though he also had a flair for a good soundbite.

“I’m a kind of fashion nymphomaniac who never gets an orgasm,” he said in 1984, asked about what he felt after a fashion show.

In a rare climbdown, he half-apologized to Oscar-winner movie actress Meryl Streep after once suggesting she had refused to wear a dress designed by him at an awards ceremony in favour of another she wanted to be paid to wear.

Lagerfeld, who moonlighted as a cartoonist in Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, took a dig at Chancellor Angela Merkel’s pro-refugee stance in a 2017 sketch that blamed her for helping a far-right party gain parliamentary seats.

The designer was not afraid of breaking the mould within often-pompous couture circles. He teamed up with high street brand H&amp;M in 2004 for limited edition collections, a move that raised eyebrows and was then quickly copied by others.

His appearance changed over the years along with his affectations, such as a fan he at one time carried and fluttered incessantly.

Known to adore Diet Coke, Lagerfeld said he shed weight in the early 2000s to fit into the razor-thin suits brought in by Christian Dior’s then menswear designer Hedi Slimane.

In rare moments when he was not working, Lagerfeld retired to one of his many homes in Paris, Germany, Italy or Monaco, all of them lavish carbon copies of 18th-century interiors.","__label__Positive"
1412,"Acquisitions boost Scott Tech operating earnings","Oct. 25 (BusinessDesk) - Scott Technology reported a 12 percent jump in annual operating earnings after completing acquisitions in the US and Europe earlier this year.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation climbed to $19.3 million in the year ended Aug. 31, up from $17.3 million a year earlier.
Revenue jumped 37 percent to $181.8 million, with about two-thirds of the increase due to the firm’s purchase of the Belgian industrial automation specialist Alvey Group in April and North Carolina-based automated guided vehicle manufacturer Transbotics in June.
“Sales into our traditional markets of the appliances, meat processing and mining sectors all achieved double-digit growth, with the appliance sector being the stand out performer with a 56 percent increase from the prior year,” the company said in a statement to NZX. “This reflects several large projects successfully sold, worked on and completed collaboratively across the company’s New Zealand, German and Chinese operations.”
Net profit fell about 7 percent to $8.96 million, largely due to a $1.5 million loss on currency translations of foreign operations.
Scott shares were unchanged at $2.90 in a generally weaker market. The stock is down about 18 percent this year.
Dunedin-based Scott Technology has more than 700 staff worldwide. In 2017 it got more than a third of its sales in Australia, with its next largest markets being the US at 27 percent and China at 12 percent.
It is half owned by Brazilian meat processor JBS.
The latest accounts show Australia and New Zealand accounted for about $100.5 million of Scott’s group revenue and $19 million of the company’s pre-tax segment earnings of $24.2 million.
With the latest acquisitions complete, Scott said its focus is firmly on integrating the businesses acquired, and driving synergies and operational benefits across the combined business.
It is continuing to invest in research and will develop new applications across all key industries it now serves. It has also commenced “significant projects” aimed at transferring its technology and capability from lamb deboning to other species, such as beef, pork and poultry.
The company will pay a 6 cent final dividend on Nov. 27, unchanged from a year earlier.","__label__Neutral"
2058,"Cooking up Alien Atmospheres on Earth","Researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, are cooking up an alien atmosphere right here on Earth.

In a new study, JPL scientists used a high-temperature “oven” to heat a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide to more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,100 Celsius), about the temperature of molten lava. The aim was to simulate conditions that might be found in the atmospheres of a special class of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) called “hot Jupiters.”

Hot Jupiters are gas giants that orbit very close to their parent star, unlike any of the planets in our solar system. While Earth takes 365 days to orbit the Sun, hot Jupiters orbit their stars in less than 10 days. Their close proximity to a star means their temperatures can range from 1,000 to 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (530 to 2,800 degrees Celsius) or even hotter . By comparison, a hot day on the surface of Mercury (which takes 88 days to orbit the Sun) reaches about 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius).

“Though it is impossible to exactly simulate in the laboratory these harsh exoplanet environments, we can come very close,” said JPL principal scientist Murthy Gudipati, who leads the group that conducted the new study, published last month in the Astrophysical Journal .

The team started with a simple chemical mixture of mostly hydrogen gas and 0.3 percent carbon monoxide gas. These molecules are extremely common in the universe and in early solar systems, and they could reasonably compose the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter. Then the team heated the mixture to between 620 and 2,240 degrees Fahrenheit (330 and 1,230 Celsius).

The team also exposed the laboratory brew to a high dose of ultraviolet radiation — similar to what a hot Jupiter would experience orbiting so close to its parent star. The UV light proved to be a potent ingredient. It was largely responsible for some of the study’s more surprising results about the chemistry that might be taking place in these toasty atmospheres.

Hot Jupiters are large by planet standards, and they radiate more light than cooler planets. Such factors have allowed astronomers to gather more information about their atmospheres than most other types of exoplanets. Those observations reveal that many hot Jupiter atmospheres are opaque at high altitudes. Although clouds might explain the opacity, they become less and less sustainable as the pressure decreases, and the opacity has been observed where the atmospheric pressure is very low.

Scientists have been looking for potential explanations other than clouds, and aerosols — solid particles suspended in the atmosphere — could be one. However, according to the JPL researchers, scientists were previously unaware of how aerosols might develop in hot Jupiter atmospheres . In the new experiment, adding UV light to the hot chemical mix did the trick.

“This result changes the way we interpret those hazy hot Jupiter atmospheres,” said Benjamin Fleury, a JPL research scientist and lead author of the study. “Going forward, we want to study the properties of these aerosols. We want to better understand how they form, how they absorb light and how they respond to changes in the environment. All that information can help astronomers understand what they’re seeing when they observe these planets.”

The study yielded another surprise: The chemical reactions produced significant amounts of carbon dioxide and water. While water vapor has been found in hot Jupiter atmospheres, scientists for the most part expect this precious molecule to form only when there is more oxygen than carbon. The new study shows that water can form when carbon and oxygen are present in equal amounts. (Carbon monoxide contains one carbon atom and one oxygen atom.) And while some carbon dioxide (one carbon and two oxygen atoms) formed without the addition of UV radiation, the reactions accelerated with the addition of simulated starlight.

“These new results are immediately useful for interpreting what we see in hot Jupiter atmospheres,” said JPL exoplanet scientist Mark Swain, a study coauthor. “We’ve assumed that temperature dominates the chemistry in these atmospheres, but this shows we need to look at how radiation plays a role.”

With next-generation tools like NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope , set to launch in 2021, scientists might produce the first detailed chemical profiles of exoplanet atmospheres, and it’s possible that some of those first subjects will be hot Jupiters. These studies will help scientists learn how other solar systems form and how similar or different they are to our own.

For the JPL researchers, the work has just begun. Unlike a typical oven, theirs seals the gas in tightly to prevent leaks or contamination, and it allows the researchers to control the pressure of the gas as the temperature rises. With this hardware, they can now simulate exoplanet atmospheres at even higher temperatures: close to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,600 degrees Celsius).

“It’s been an ongoing challenge figuring out how to design and operate this system successfully, since most standard components such as glass or aluminum melt at these temperatures,” said JPL research scientist Bryana Henderson, a coauthor of the study. “We’re still learning how to push these boundaries while safely handling these chemical processes in the lab. But at the end of the day, the exciting results that come out of these experiments is worth all the extra effort.”

2633,"Alex Trebek is a fighter — but what’s the prognosis for stage 4 pancreatic cancer?","On Wednesday, “Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek revealed that he’s been diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.
In the video message announcing his diagnosis, the game-show vet is optimistic: “Normally, the prognosis for this is not very encouraging,” says the 78-year-old. “But I’m going to fight this and I’m going to keep working and with the love and support from my family and friends and with the help of your prayers also, I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease.”
It’s an inspiring speech — but sadly, the odds aren’t in Trebek’s favor.
“Unfortunately, the prognosis is poor for patients with stage 4 pancreas cancer,” Daniel M. Labow, M.D., chief of Mount Sinai Hospital’s surgical oncology division, tells The Post. “In general, five-year survival rates are between 5 and 10 percent.”
The median survival rate for patients like Trebek is about a year, he says. Exactly how long depends on how they react to chemotherapy treatment, which targets cancerous cells in the body to “shrink the disease and keep it from spreading” further.
Even if you respond well to chemo, stage 4 cancers aren’t technically “curable” — just treatable, Labow says. The stages of cancer range from 0 (no cancer, only abnormal cells) to 4, with 4 being the most serious: It means that the disease has advanced to other parts of the body. With earlier stages, patients can be cured and tend to live longer.
That doesn’t mean stage 4 pancreatic cancer can’t be medically managed, and that people can’t live with the disease, Labow says. For lucky patients, “there can be long-term survival.” But unfortunately, most patients with a cancer this advanced “succumb to the disease.”","__label__Neutral"

2397,"When the Yankees will decide on the wild-card starter","Chris Sale alarms go off, and Yankees may be catching a break
Once the Yankees know the wild-card game will be in The Bronx, Boone said he will have a clearer indication of who will start the biggest game of the Yankees’ season.
“Hopefully we get to a point this weekend where we are really juggling it to the point where we set up the way we want,” Boone said. “At this point we are having casual conversations between us. I am sure we will get after it this weekend.’’
Asked if he might be tempted to hold Happ, who has gone 7-4 with a 2.82 ERA in 20 career appearances (19 starts) against the Red Sox and 4-2 with a 2,91 ERA in nine games (eight starts) at Fenway Park, for the best-of-five ALDS, provided the Yankees topple the A’s, Boone said he isn’t looking past the wild-card game.
“I would say we are going to pour everything into the wild-card game and what we thinks gives us the best chance,’’ Boone said. “Again, we feel like in a lot of ways we are dealing with a few different really good options that whoever doesn’t [start the wild card] makes sense going into the next series. We are going to do the best we can to determine what path we like the best going into that Wednesday game.”
Boone said there is “probably a chance” Lance Lynn, who is slated to start Saturday, could have a spot in the Yankees’ bullpen for the wild-card game and beyond.
That could remain the same should the Yankees advance to the best-of-five ALDS, where they would need a fourth starter against the Red Sox.
“Obviously, CC [Sabathia] would probably be that guy and Lynn we will feel like will play an important role for in the postseason whether that is in a starting role or being a tough righty out of the pen that we like in certain matchups,” Boone said. “That’s a little bit further down the line, but those would be the obvious guys you would consider.”
In 10 games (nine starts) with the Yankees since coming from the Twins in late July, Lynn is 2-2 with a 4.21 ERA and has struck out 57 in 51 ¹/₃ innings. Right-handed hitters are batting .229 (25-for-109) against Lynn, so he could be a weapon versus them, but might need help against lefties, who are batting .320 (31-for-97).
Didi Gregorius and Aaron Hicks worked out on the field before Thursday’s game and each reported batting practice went well.
Boone was more optimistic Hicks would return to the lineup ahead of Gregorius. Asked if he expected either to play in Boston, Boone was a bit reserved about Gregorius, who hasn’t played since Saturday due to torn cartilage in his right wrist.
“We will see on Didi. Hope he continues to get through each day,” Boone said of his shortstop, who took batting practice on the field for the first time and fielded ground balls. “Leaning on the doctors to make sure he is good to go.”
Boone said he expects Hicks, who left Monday night’s game with a tight left hamstring and hasn’t played since, to be in the lineup Friday night.
Neil Walker left Wednesday night’s game after getting hit on the left shin by a pitch, but was in Thursday’s lineup at third base.
It was the fourth straight game Walker, a more consistently solid defender than rookie Miguel Andujar, started at third in a game Sabathia started. The last time Andujar started at third with Sabathia on the mound was Sept. 5.
Andujar was the designated hitter, and his three-run homer highlighted a four-run first inning.
Lost in Sabathia’s ejection in the sixth inning was he earned his 129th victory as a Yankee, pushing him ahead of Jack Chesbro into 11th place on the franchise’s all-time list. It was Sabathia’s 246th career victory, tying Joe McGinnity for 50th place on MLB’s all-time list. With 538 starts, Sabathia is tied with Red Ruffing for 32nd place on the all-time list.
With 27 home runs, Andujar is two homers short of tying Joe DiMaggio for the second most by a Yankees rookie. Aaron Judge’s 52 last year leads the list.
Boone was ejected with Sabathia in the sixth inning. It was his fourth ejection this year.","__label__Neutral"

993,"Evening News Shows Ignore Crazy Socialist Green New Deal","Going “green” will require a lot of green, apparently. Two U.S. legislators have a proposal designed to require substantial changes to every building in the U.S., create rail “at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary,” replace all “combustion engine-vehicles” within a decade, and guarantee everyone a “job,” higher education, “healthy food,” and much more.

An outlandish socialist fantasy like this so-called plan that “ would spend the U.S. into oblivion ,” needs to be covered honestly by the news media. Especially when so many of the liberals planning to run against President Donald Trump in 2020 support it. That’s why the ABC, CBS and NBC evening news shows were loudly silent on the subject Feb. 7.

All three shows failed to cover the kooky Green New Deal proposal announced by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that very day. Their FAQ sheet claimed a Green New Deal “has momentum” including large support of Democrats and Republican voters. However, the poll those figures came from was taken before any clarity of what the plan would include or cost.

That was one very important reason for the media to cover details of the proposal. Details such as getting rid of all combustion-engine vehicles, arranging to “upgrade or replace every building in U.S. for state-of-the-art energy efficiency,” building enough high speed rail to make “ air travel” unnecessary and provide government guaranteed jobs, housing, education and “healthy food.”

Those additional non-environmental, social programs even left Bloomberg opinion columnist Noah Smith seeing the Green New Deal as “ unaffordable .” “This quick, rough cost estimate — which doesn’t include all of the promises listed in the FAQ — adds up to about $6.6 trillion a year,” Smith wrote.

Another reason the networks should have reported the proposal is that many of the liberals running for president want it to become law.

According to Markey and Ocasio-Cortez, “nearly every major Democratic Presidential contender” backs a Green New Deal. They specifically listed supporters Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, as well as former HUD director Julian Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and lesser known liberals.

ABC News did cover the proposal online on Feb. 7, but excluded conservative criticism from its story. It quoted proposal creators Ocasio-Cortez and Markey, included supportive remarks from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and mentioned that left-wing critics were upset that it lacked “regulatory efforts aimed at fossil fuel production.” In other words, setting the goal to eliminate all fossil fuels and nuclear energy was insufficient for some liberals.

But there was no criticism of the cost or any of the ludicrous proposals.

ABC’s online story also ignored the socialist wish list of guaranteed jobs, education, food, healthcare, housing and “economic security for all those unable or unwilling to work” from the Green New Deal proposal.

196,"If you work for a living, America taxes you at double the rate of wealthy investors with ""unearned income""","Starting in the early 1990s with a Democratic Congress (and continued by other congresses, Republican and Democrat, since), the rate of tax on ""passive, unearned income"" has been in decline, but someone has to pay to keep Uncle Sam's lights on, so the tax on workers' wages have diverged, until today, when the tax bite out of a worker's wage is double the tax taken on wealthy investor with the same amount in ""passive income.""
The easy explanation for this is that workers don't change their behavior when you raise payroll taxes (you still show up for work because you still you have to pay your mortgage), while investors are prone to changing their behavior depending on the tax code.
The more complete explanation is that, since the Reagan years, the share of national wealth owned by the richest Americans has gone up and up, and so has their political power, and so the political will to tax the wealth of the 10%, the 1% and the 0.1% has been steadily leached out of US politics.
Taxing workers more than investors is fair, conservatives also argue, because investors and workers are really the same people at different stages of their lives. When you’re young, you save and pay high tax rates on your wages. When you’re old, you get to enjoy the lightly taxed proceeds of that invested income.
The wrench in these arguments is the massive jump in inherited American wealth—driven by rising income inequality and loose tax laws. In practice, the person who successfully accumulates assets is often not the person who spends them. Affluent retirees are increasingly reluctant to even touch their nest eggs. A huge and disproportionate share of the nation’s largest fortunes is in the hands of people in their 80s and 90s. And the estate tax, already very easy for the wealthy to avoid, is targeted for elimination by the Trump administration.
As a result, an unprecedented amount of wealth may soon be inherited. The generation on the receiving end of this familial largesse will get a tax break every time they cash in on the fruits of others’ labor.","__label__Negative"

190,"Trump says Saudi explanation of journalist’s death credible after Riyadh blames consulate ‘fistfight’","ISTANBUL/WASHINGTON – Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a “fistfight” in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, the kingdom claimed early Saturday, admitting that the writer had been slain at its diplomatic post for the first time. Authorities said 18 Saudi suspects were in custody for his slaying and intelligence officials had been fired.
The overnight announcements in Saudi state media came more than two weeks after Khashoggi, 59, entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul for paperwork required to marry his Turkish fiancee, and never came out. Since his disappearance, the kingdom had rejected Turkish fears he was killed and dismembered there as “baseless,” but growing international pressure and comments by U.S. officials up to President Donald Trump appears to have forced the kingdom to acknowledge the slaying.
While it fired officials close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom stopped short of implicating the heir-apparent of the world’s largest oil exporter. King Salman, his father, appointed him to lead a committee that will restructure the kingdom’s intelligence services after Khashoggi’s death. No major decisions in Saudi Arabia are made outside of the ultraconservative kingdom’s ruling Al Saud family.
It also offered a far different version of events than those given by Turkish officials, who have said an “assassination squad” from the kingdom including an official from Prince Mohammed’s entourage and an “autopsy expert” flew in ahead of time and laid in wait for Khashoggi at the consulate. Beyond its statements attributed to anonymous officials, Saudi Arabia offered no evidence to support its claims.
In a statement Friday night, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. will closely follow international investigations into Khashoggi’s death and will advocate for justice that is “timely, transparent and in accordance with all due process.”
And he said that if the U.S. did take action over Khashoggi’s death, he does not want it to impact arms sales to the kingdom.
“I do, I do,” Trump said when asked if he found the Saudis’ explanation credible, adding: “It’s early, we haven’t finished our review or investigation, but … I think it’s a very important first step.”
“I would prefer, if there is going to be some form of sanction or what we may determine to do, if anything … that we don’t use as retribution canceling $110 billion worth of work, which means 600,000 jobs,” he said during a visit to Arizona, referring to a major arms deal with the kingdom.
The announcements from the kingdom came in a flurry of statements carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency early Saturday morning.
“Preliminary investigations conducted by the Public Prosecution showed that the suspects had traveled to Istanbul to meet with the citizen Jamal Khashoggi as there were indications of the possibility of his returning back to the country,” the statement read, though there’s been no indication Khashoggi had immediate plans to return to the kingdom. “Discussions took place with the citizen Jamal Khashoggi during his presence in the consulate of the kingdom in Istanbul by the suspects (that) did not go as required and developed in a negative way, leading to a fistfight. The brawl led to his death and their attempt to conceal and hide what happened.”
The Saudi statements did not identify the 18 Saudis being held by authorities and gave no explanation how 18 people could be involved in one “fistfight.” Nor did the statements explain what happened to Khashoggi’s body after his death.
“The kingdom expresses its deep regret at the painful developments that have taken place and stresses the commitment of the authorities in the kingdom to bring the facts to the public opinion, to hold all those involved accountable and bring them to justice,” the statement said.
The kingdom at the same time announced the firing of four top intelligence officials, including Maj. Gen. Ahmed bin Hassan Assiri, a one-time spokesman for the Saudi military’s campaign in Yemen who later became a confidant of Prince Mohammed. Separately fired was Saud Qahtani, a powerful adviser to Prince Mohammed who led Saudi efforts to isolate Qatar amid a boycott of the country by the kingdom and three other Arab nations as part of a political dispute.
On Twitter, where Qahtani had launched vitriolic attacks against those he saw as the kingdom’s enemies, he thanked the Saudi government for the “great opportunity they gave me to serve my country all those years”
“I will remain a loyal servant to my country for all times,” he wrote.
Assiri had no immediate comment.
On Wednesday, the Turkish pro-government newspaper Yeni Safak, citing what it described as an audio recording of Khashoggi’s slaying, said the squad immediately accosted the journalist after he entered the consulate, cutting off his fingers and later decapitating him. On Thursday, a leaked surveillance photo put Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a member of Prince Mohammed’s entourage on trips to the U.S., France and Spain this year, at the consulate just ahead of Khashoggi’s arrival.
Turkish crime scene investigators this week searched the Saudi Consulate building in Istanbul and the nearby residence of the Saudi consul general, and came out carrying bags and boxes. On Friday, investigators questioned staff and explored whether his remains could have been dumped outside Istanbul after his suspected killing, Turkish media and a security official said.
Khashoggi, a prominent journalist and royal court insider for decades in Saudi Arabia, had written columns for The Washington Post critical of Prince Mohammed and the kingdom’s direction while living in self-imposed exile in the U.S.
Trump had earlier said that the consequences for the Saudis “will have to be very severe” if they are found to have killed him, but has insisted that more facts must be known before making any judgments. He had dispatched U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier this week to both Saudi Arabia and Turkey to speak to officials on the case.
The president has made close ties to the kingdom a priority since taking office. Trump made his first overseas trip as president to Saudi Arabia and has touted his arms sales to the kingdom. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, responsible for a coming peace proposal for Israel and the Palestinians, also has forged a close relationship with Prince Mohammed.
Trump’s previous warnings over the case drew an angry response Sunday from Saudi Arabia and its state-linked media, including a suggestion that Riyadh could wield its oil production as a weapon. The U.S. president wants King Salman and OPEC to boost production to drive down high oil prices, caused in part by the coming re-imposition of oil sanctions on Iran in November.
It’s unclear whether the Saudi announcement will be enough to staunch the criticism the kingdom faces from lawmakers in the U.S., its most-crucial ally. California Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, called the Saudi Arabia’s claim that Khashoggi was “killed while brawling with a team of more than a dozen dispatched from Saudi Arabia is not credible.”
He he was “fighting for his life with people sent to capture or kill him,” Schiff said.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who earlier this week said in a televised interview that Prince Mohammed “has got to go,” added: “To say that I am skeptical of the new Saudi narrative about Mr. Khashoggi is an understatement.”
Human rights groups like Amnesty International separately have been calling for a United Nations investigation into Khashoggi’s killing.
“All along we were concerned about a whitewash, or an investigation by the entity suspected of involvement itself,” Amnesty’s Rawya Rageh said Saturday. “The impartiality of a Saudi investigation would remain in question.”","__label__Neutral"
838,"Man Rushes Stage at Beyoncé and Jay-Z's On the Run II Tour Concert","by Corinne Heller &amp; Holly Passalaqua | Sun., Aug. 26, 2018 2:43 PM

UPDATE: An Atlanta Police Department spokesperson told E! News, ""As the Jay-Z and Beyonce concert was ending late Saturday night, a man later identified as Anthony Charles Thomas Maxwell (age 26) ran onto the stage and approached Jay-Z. He was quickly stopped by people who were with the performer. Atlanta Police arrived and issued the man a citation for disorderly conduct and released him.""

""At the time, there was no evidence Maxwell had made contact with Jay-Z,"" the spokesperson said. ""Upon later investigation, officers were able to gather evidence showing Maxwell had, in fact, made contact with Jay-Z. Maxwell was treated for minor injuries on scene sustained when people around Jay-Z stopped him from further contact with the performer. No one else was injured as a result of this incident.""

The spokesperson added that police have secured warrants that would upgrade the man's charges to simple battery, adding that ""he is not in custody right now.""

Beyoncé , Jay-Z, their crew and their fans had a bit of a scare on Saturday night when a man rushed the stage during their show in Atlanta.

The couple was unharmed, partially thanks to the help of their backup dancers and security men, who sprang into action.

Bey and Jay had just finished performing their final song, their new single ""Apes--t,"" at Mercedes-Benz Stadium when a man in a white jersey took off running up some steps to the stage and made his way towards the back in the direction of the couple. Nearby backup dancers were rendered stunned for a moment before they gave chase and confronted the person, prompting a short scuffle. They and a few security men then subdued him.

""At the end of last night's show, we had an intoxicated male enter the stage,"" read a statement from Beyoncé and Jay-Z's On the Run II tour. ""At this point, we had a controlled evacuation of all crew on the stage in order to safely defuse the situation. We are happy to confirm that nobody was hurt during the incident, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Carter are choosing not to press charges against the individual.""

""We would like to thank the hard work of our tour security who effectively restrained the individual and all of our dancers and team who handled the situation so professionally,"" the statement said. ""Mr. &amp; Mrs. Carter look forward to seeing you all tomorrow in Atlanta.""

""Thank you to all the fans for your concern,"" the singer's publicist wrote on Instagram , alongside a photo of the two performing. ""They are fine and looking forward to the show tomorrow.""","__label__Neutral"
2576,"Community Awards open for nominations on 1 April","The Kāpiti Coast District’s annual Civic Awards paired with the Wellington Airport Regional Community Awards are back again to honour the outstanding people who make our neighbourhoods and communities the special places they are.
Mayor K Gurunathan says that while the awards are annual, this year’s round is particularly poignant in light of how New Zealand has been on the world stage over the past few weeks, demonstrating how inclusive, engaged, and kind communities can be.
“This year the awards come at a time when we are all turning our focus inward on our communities, on our neighbours, and how to look after one another – despite all of our differences – and possibly because of them. We’re seeing the incredible resilience and connectedness of our communities and our neighbourhoods.
“We’re celebrating what makes the Kāpiti Coast so unique, and the often quiet heroes in the background who volunteer tireless hours and lend generous skills and effort all year round to lead our communities to grow and support themselves.”
The Civic Awards are our area’s highest honour for individual residents who’ve made a lasting impact in the community. Based on public nominations, Council gives awards based on exemplary volunteer   service or outstanding service in their professional field.
Nominees are volunteers in areas like the environment, social services, education, youth, and culture.
The Wellington Airport Regional Community Awards recognise the contributions made by community groups in six categories: arts and culture, education and youth development, health and wellbeing, heritage and environment, sports and leisure, and rising star.
To nominate a deserving recipient for the Civic Award or to put a group forward for the Wellington Airport Regional Community Awards, see www.kapiticoast.govt.nz/civic-awards Nominations open on Monday 1 April, but hurry because nominations close 31 May.

524,"‘Conservative’ seeks Democratic Socialist’s endorsement in public advocate race","Councilman Rafael Espinal is the life of the party — too many parties and ideologies, critics say.

The Brooklyn councilman, who is running for public advocate, identified himself in a recent questionnaire as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America while seeking the group’s endorsement.

But the Democrat ran on the Conservative Party line during his first two successful runs for state Assembly in 2011 and 2012.

That’s the right-wing party that is opposed to everything the DSA stands for. The Conservatives support the death penalty, oppose gun control and abortion rights, and back police tactics such as stop- and-frisk.

The Conservatives also believe that local government and courts should help the feds deport illegal residents residing in New York and oppose Dream Act legislation to provide tuition assistance to undocumented students.

Espinal’s earlier alliance with the Conservative Party — and shift to the left in recent years, which includes endorsing Bernie Sanders for president in 2016 — is drawing attention as he seeks the public advocate’s post, a stepping stone to the mayoralty.

A rival running for public advocate said Espinal has a lot of explaining to do.

“Running on the Conservative Party line is a political liability,” said candidate Nomiki Konst. “That means Espinal supported that party’s platform. He’s a politician.”

Former Brooklyn Conservative Party Chairman Jerry Kassar said Espinal once actively courted party members for support.

“Espinal clearly moved away from us,” Kassar said. “There’s no communication with the Conservative Party anymore. He went full boat moving to the other side.”

At the time, Espinal was also backed by the Brooklyn Democratic machine led by Vito Lopez. Espinal defended his prior affiliation with the Conservative Party.

“I have always been a liberal Democrat and ran as a Democrat, but I represented a district that had very different views on social issues than I did,” he said in a statement.

Former City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito is in the running...

“And when I first ran in 2011 at the age of 26, I believed that it was my responsibility to be accountable to the majority of the voices,” the statement continued. “But from being a leading advocate for the environment to being the first NYC official to endorse Bernie Sanders in 2016, I think it’s clear that my views have been more aligned with the DSA.”

He also sought backing from the Working Families Party at the same time he wooed the Conservatives.

Espinal is respected for his work on the council, including repealing the antiquated Cabaret Law, which prohibited bars and clubs from allowing dancing without a special license.

He isn’t the only candidate who has experienced a sea change.

Fellow Brooklyn Councilman and public-advocate candidate Jumaane Williams disavowed his prior personal opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion. In 2014, he took heat for abstaining from a vote to allow transgender New Yorkers to change their sex on birth certificates. He now embraces LGBT and abortion rights.","__label__Neutral"
2244,"Fictiv raises $33M to be the ‘AWS of hardware manufacturing’","Hardware, as the saying goes, is hard, but today a startup has raised some money for a manufacturing service that it believes can make the prospect of starting and running hardware businesses a little easier. Fictiv, which positions itself as a kind of AWS for manufacturing — providing a platform both to design components and help get them produced — has raised $33 million, money that it will use to continue expanding its production ecosystem, the range of components that it can make, and to grow its customer base.  The company is not disclosing its valuation, but, according to PitchBook, the company was valued at around $65 million post-money in its last fundraise, which could put the company at around $100 million with this latest injection. This Series C was led by G2VP, with new strategic investor Mitsui &amp; Co. and previous backers  Accel, Bill Gates, Intel Capital, Sinovation and Tandon Group, also participating. Fictiv has raised $58 million to date.  Injection may be the operative word here — or at least one of them. Fictiv  today works across manufacturing plants in China and the Bay Area, covering a range of processes, including injection molding, CNC machining, 3D printing and urethane casting, covering a variety of materials. Customers use the company’s cloud-based software to design and order parts which are routed by Fictiv to the plants best suited to make them. Current customers include the likes of Sphero and Facebook, which use Fictiv’s services for prototyping,  The problem that Fictiv is solving has been a persistent one in the world of hardware: making prototypes can cost a lot and be very inefficient, and that’s before you move into full-scale manufacturing, which can be challenging even with economies of scale. It’s also a very crowded field, with a number of different companies all vying to help fill the role of manufacturing enabler (and it is a field also littered with failures). But over the years, we’ve seen a lot of advances in manufacturing tech, with the tradeoff that some of the work that it takes on freeing up staff to work on other challenges.  “Fictiv is developing the software infrastructure required to connect the manufacturing workforce and trillions of dollars of capital equipment,” said CEO Dave Evans, who co-founded the company with Nate Evans, in a statement. “In doing so, both product developers and manufacturers will benefit from the efficiencies gained by eliminating unnecessary, repetitive tasks and unlocking employees to focus on creative problem solving.”  “We are excited to be part of the digital transformation of the status quo in manufacturing,” said ​Daniel Oros​, Partner at G2VP, in a statement. “Fictiv’s innovative tools and services address the critical gap in contract manufacturing that will lead to a massive shift in how consumer and industrial products are manufactured.”","__label__Neutral"
1770,"7 Meaningful Things You Do With Your Sister In Your 20s That Make This Decade So Much Better","Your 20s is a really formative period of your life. You may be going through a ton of changes, including graduating college, moving to a new city, starting a new relationship, or maybe even getting married and starting a family. But despite all of these changes, one thing remains constant: The love and support you receive from your sister. She's a huge light in your life, and there are so many meaningful things you do with your sister in your 20s that make this decade of change a whole lot better.

Your sister is one of the best people you can have in your life in your 20s. She's there to keep all of your secrets and give you advice on whatever you're dealing with, and she never hesitates to offer up some pieces from her wardrobe or makeup collection for you to borrow (ahem — steal). You always look forward to the days when the two of you can hang out together on your own, and you live for all of the times when you can finally dish out all of the gossip that you've been storing up for a wine night with her.

Though you might be going through a lot of change in your 20s, you know that you can always count on having your sister by your side through it all. Here are just a few of the things that the two of you love to do together.

In your 20s, you need people in your corner whom you can truly trust, and your sister is definitely one of those people. You've known her for most or all of your life, and she's someone you can always depend on to keep your secrets.

Whether you're about to ask out someone you really like, or have plans to surprise your BFF for their birthday, your sis can keep all of your secrets when you feel like you can't keep them to yourself.

What are sisters for if not to steal things from each others' closets and vanities? Even though the two of you are totally different people, your sisterhood means that your sense of style is inherently linked somehow, and now that you're in your 20s, you're likely more game to share than you were when you were younger.

There's nothing like the magic of a new crush and all the butterflies that come with it. When you want to share the news and dish on all of the details, your sister is one of the first people you turn to. She's always there to confirm how cute your crush is, and she never hesitates to tell you to go for it.

Now that the two of your are older, you voluntarily take time to have fun together, and you look forward to days when the two of you can catch up in a totally fun setting. My sis and I love taking sister days to go to Disney World together when I'm home, and those days with just the two of us (or the two of us with her 2-year-old daughter) are some of the highlights of my 20s so far.

No matter how old you are, you and your sister can always gossip together like you're still in high school. You can pull each other aside during giant family reunions to chat about your uncle's new haircut or the aunt who's asking all the pressing relationship questions, or even text each other when you see the same buzz-worthy status update on Facebook. It never gets tiresome sharing those little moments with each other.

Being an adult means that you may deal with some transitional struggles. While my sister is eight years older than me, I've learned a ton from her about adulting — like buying a house, paying bills on time, and having a baby — but she regularly asks me for makeup advice, and I feel honored that she turns to me for help even though I'm younger.

Even if your sister isn't older than you, she always knows exactly the right thing to say when you're in a pickle (and vice versa). She's an amazing and helpful voice of reason when you're struggling with something, and you can always count on her to give you sage advice.","__label__Positive"
738,"China Cutting Tariffs On 700 Items Amid Push To Boost Imports By $30 Trillion","As part of China's efforts to open its economy - something its leaders have been touting at least since President Xi's keynote speech at the 2017 World Economic Forum - Xi revealed on Monday a detailed breakdown of what will be the third round of tariff reductions this year, measures that were teased by President Xi during a speech nearly two months ago.

The plans to spend more on foreign goods are part of China's plan to import an additional $30 trillion over the next 15 years as the world's second-largest economy continues its transition from an industrial powerhouse to a service-focused economy, according to Bloomberg .

In addition to the $30 trillion in goods (which is higher than the $24 trillion previously promised by Xi), China is also hoping to increase services imports by $10 trillion during the same period. The measures come as China is weighing whether to abandon its ""Made in China 2025"" initiative and speed up the liberalization of its economy and its openness to foreign competition as a means of reducing wasteful state-directed spending that has heavily contributed to the massive pile of bad debt swirling around China's corporate sector.

The tariffs will have the added bonus of cutting costs for Chinese consumers at a time when a dramatically weaker yuan is expected to stoke inflation. The announcement follows a raft of disappointing economic data released earlier this month raised fears of a global recession (and sent stocks around the world tumbling lower).

Before Trump takes credit for the cuts as another victory in his trade war with China, Bloomberg pointed out that Xi's latest comments ""don't move the needle very far on trade policy"". China has already cut tariffs this year (case in point: the recent reductions in auto tariffs) and has repeatedly said it's planning more cuts.

The lowered tariffs, which will impact some 700 goods, will take effect on Jan. 1. The ""temporary"" rates can be changed at will and also can be lower than the current most-favored nations levels, though these tariffs will also apply to goods imported from all WTO members.

With tariffs on U.S. soybeans stopping a key source of edible meal (often used for animal feed), China will implement zero tariffs on imports of a variety of meals including sunflower and canola.

Some materials for pharmaceutical manufacturing will also be subject to zero tariffs, and taxes on high-tech imports will be set ""relatively low,"" including at 1 percent for a type of generator for aircraft, and 5 percent for a type of welding robots used in car assembly lines.

The ministry said MFN tariffs will be further cut for a wide-range of information technology imports starting from July 1, 2019, including for medical diagnosis machines, speakers and printers, according to a separate table on its website.

The nation will also scrap export tariffs on 94 items of products starting from the new year, including fertilizers, iron ore, coal tar, and wood pulp. Export tariffs on these goods are as high as 40 percent currently.

Imports from nations that have reached a trade pact with China will be levied at the rates agreed by both sides. China’s bilateral deals with New Zealand, Peru, Costa Rica, Switzerland, Iceland, South Korea, Australia, Georgia already included promises to further lower tariffs in 2019, as does the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement.

Imports from Hong Kong, Macau will also enjoy lower taxes.

China's stated plans to liberalize its economy could help improve the chances for an enduring trade pact with the US, as one of Trump's central demands is that the Communist Party take steps to narrow China's trade surplus with the US. Then again, China has a long and storied history of promising to open up its markets - a process which created holes in its storied captial account firewall; whether it actually follows up on them has been a different matter entirely.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google’s new Pixel phones mirror the industry trend moving the devices toward lusher, bigger screens and add new twists on the camera for taking better selfies and other pictures.
The Pixels have barely made a dent in the market since their debut two years ago, but Google is hoping to change that with the latest models unveiled Tuesday at an event in New York.
Google uses the phones to highlight what it considers to be best features of its Android operating system, while challenging Apple and Samsung with a device tailored for affluent consumers.

The third generation of Pixel phones comes in two sizes, and both feature high-definition screens that span from one edge to another. It’s the first time Google has embraced the format, which Apple adopted last year with its ballyhooed iPhone X.

Google is undercutting Apple on the pricing of its phones. It’s also hiring photographer Annie Leibovitz to take pictures with the new Pixel in an effort to persuade consumers its camera is superior to the iPhone XS that Apple released last month.
The Pixel 3 will be available Oct. 18 and sell at prices starting at $799. That’s $200 below the least expensive iPhone XS.
Google also rolled out a new device called Home Hub that couples a small display screen with an internet-connected speaker. That’s similar to Amazon’s Echo Show and a new Facebook device called Portal.
But again Google is attacking its rivals on the pricing front. The Home Hub will sell for $149 when it comes to stores Oct. 22. The new version Echo Show starts at $229, while the least expensive Facebook Portal sells for $199.

As usual, the Pixels focus heavily on Google’s search engine, maps, digital assistant and YouTube video service.
While all those service are hugely popular, the Pixels so far have generated more media attention than sales. Google has sold an estimated 7 million Pixels over the past two years, almost imperceptible next to the 3.6 billion phones shipped during that time, according to the research firm International Data Corp.
Google doesn’t disclose its phone shipments, unlike Apple, which has sold about 388 million iPhones since the first Pixel came out in October 2016.
“If you have a Google tattoo on you, then these are the phones for you,” IDC analyst Ramon Llamas said of the Pixel’s limited appeal so far.
Google has been somewhat restrained in its distribution and marketing of the Pixel phones, Llamas said, because it doesn’t want to alienate Samsung and hundreds of other device makers that feature Android in their own phones. Because Android highlights Google services, it’s key to Google’s business of selling ads through its search engine and other mobile apps.
The iPhone also features Google’s search engine, but Google may be paying Apple as much as $9 billion annually for that privilege, based on the estimates of Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall.","__label__Neutral"

New lead Colton Underwood and his abs are featured in full glory, but it looks like sunny shots of Colton lifting tires and cuddling with contestants will definitely dwindle throughout the season. Colton's first Bachelor promo captures the former NFL player appearing to crack under the show's pressure. Time to stock up on your Monday night wine!
Premiering on Jan. 7, Season 23 of The Bachelor recruited 26-year-old Colton after he finished in fourth place on Becca Kufrin's Bachelorette season. After developing a reputation on The Bachelorette for his pre-show relationship with Bachelor contestant Tia Booth and pursuing her again on Bachelor in Paradise, fans definitely leaned toward seeing more than enough of Colton. ABC selecting him as the next leading man over fan favorites Jason Tartick and Blake Horstmann then caused a stir within Bachelor Nation. Well, whether or not you've made your peace with the choice, The Bachelor's first full teaser promises what could be...the most dramatic season ever.
Kicking off with gratuitous shots of Colton's shirtless body, the season preview first features the women canoodling with the Bachelor on a picturesque beach. The video then cuts to what a season poster has already promised — frequent discussions about Colton's virginity. One woman uses her limo entrance to confess about the lack of virgins she's dated, while Chris Harrison carefully approaches the topic of fantasy suite sex with Colton in another scene. It looks like cool Uncle Chris has eased up about discussing the birds and bees since Colton asked him about them last year.
Of course, a proper Bachelor trailer isn't complete without drama, screaming, and tears. The clips offer some insight into conflict between the women and their subsequent meltdowns, but what's even more intriguing is Colton's own emotion. After saying, ""I'm scared"" in a fleeting scene, he tearfully hugs a woman with a backpack, who could either be a faceless producer or a contestant who has chosen to leave early. The trailer then closes with its most dramatic moment, showing Colton storming away from Chris and vaulting himself over what are presumably the gates of Bachelor Mansion.
While Colton has tweeted since the trailer's launch to thank fans for their support , Bachelor Nation is buzzing about his feat of athleticism. Bless former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay for once escaping Chris Harrison by ducking into the ladies' room, but Colton has taken a far more dramatic route to avoid the host. Viewers are already obsessed with finding out why he felt the need for such an extra exit.
ABC is no stranger to teasing clips that are far more theatrical than what they finally air as, but here's hoping that Colton's fence-jumping is just as ridiculous as it seems. In the meantime, start analyzing the trailer for your Bachelor fantasy league picks.
Season 23 of The Bachelor premieres on Monday, Jan. 7, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.","__label__Neutral"

2131,"Despite external pressure, little talk of homosexuality at Vatican abuse summit - America Magazine","Pope Francis, background third from left, attends a penitential liturgy at the Vatican, Saturday, Feb. 23, 2019. (Vincenzo Pinto/Pool Photo Via AP)

In the months leading up to the Vatican’s four-day summit on the sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests, some U.S. prelates , activists and even some journalists tried to link homosexuality with the abuse crisis, in attempts to urge church officials to take a hard line against gay priests.

But the topic was barely broached during the summit, and when it was, leading prelates dismissed any connection.

“To generalize, to look at a whole category of people is never legitimate. We have individual cases. We don’t have categories of people,” said Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna, who has become one of the Vatican’s point man in the fight against sex abuse.

Responding to a reporter’s question during a press briefing on Feb. 21 about why the Vatican was not discussing homosexuality, he said that homosexuality and heterosexuality are “human conditions,” adding, “they are not something that predisposes to sin.”

“To generalize, to look at a whole category of people is never legitimate. We have individual cases. We don’t have categories of people.”

“I would never dare to indicate a category as a category that has a tendency to sin,” Archbishop Scicluna said.

Archbishop Scicluna said that when it comes to sexual abuse, it is most helpful to eschew “categories” and instead to look at “single cases.”

Pope Francis also seemed to dismiss the link between homosexuality and the abuse crisis. During a speech given Feb. 24, the final day of the summit, he said that the abuse of minors is “always the result of an abuse of power.” He also asked bishops to “rise above the ideological disputes and journalistic practices that often exploit, for various interests, the very tragedy experienced by the little ones.”

Juan Carlos Cruz , a survivor of sexual abuse from Chile who now lives in the United States, told America that he rejects attempts by some Catholics to pin the abuse crisis on gay priests.

“That is just a fallacy; that's cruel, and that's so far from reality,” Mr. Cruz said in a Feb. 22 interview at the Vatican. “As a gay man and as a gay Catholic, I can tell you, there are gay people that are pretty bad and there are gay people that are incredibly wonderful. There are heterosexual people that are very bad and there are heterosexual people that are wonderful.”

The timing of a controversial new book that claims to detail a network of gay clerics residing and working in the Vatican raised eyebrows, as it was released on the first day of the summit.

Frederic Martel said Inside the Closet of the Vatican does not imply that gay priests are more likely to be abusers. Speaking to America from Paris, Mr. Martel said, however, that he believes there is a link between the allegedly high number of gay men who work for the church and the culture of secrecy that has enabled the scandal to continue.

""There is no link at all between abuse and homosexuality,"" Mr. Martel said.

But he said “a culture of secrecy that is extremely strong” when it comes to gay priests, who the church has a rule officially prohibiting but which rarely enforces, “was used to protect abusers, even though this culture was not created to protect them.”

“A lot of bishops that protected abusers did so because they are in trouble themselves or they are hiding something, often related to their own homosexuality,” he said. “Often they are afraid their own sexuality will be revealed.""

While analysis of reported cases of sexual abuse by clergy in the United States shows most offenses to be against boys and young men , participants in the summit seemed intent on highlighting that many girls and young women have also been victimized by clerics.

Participants in the summit seemed intent on highlighting that many girls and young women have also been victimized by clerics.

“For me, sexual abuse of minors is not just for boys but also for girls,” said Sister Veronica Openibo , in a Feb. 23 address to the nearly 200 bishops and church leaders gathered for the summit.

An adult woman who is a survivor of sexual abuse by a priest spoke to the bishops earlier in the day, telling bishops, “when I was 11 years old, a priest from my parish destroyed my life.”

The survivor, whose identity was not revealed, said in her testimony that recurring trauma from the abuse, which she said went on for five years, resulted in complications with her pregnancy years later.

“Flashbacks and images brought everything back to me. My labor was interrupted, my child was in danger; breastfeeding was impossible because of the terrible memories that emerged,” she said. “I thought I had gone mad.”

The head of the pro-L.G.B.T. group New Ways Ministry, Francis DeBernardo, told America on Feb. 22 that he anticipated the issue of gay priests would be “more prominent” during the summit because of activity leading up to the meeting. But after reading the summit’s preparatory materials, listening to the talks and attending the press briefings, Mr. DeBernardo said, “In the Vatican, they don’t buy the theory that gay priests are the cause” of the abuse crisis.

There does not seem to be much agreement about the root causes of the abuse crisis, which flared up again last summer in the United States following the release of a grand jury report in Pennsylvania detailing abuse allegations there. Pope Francis and his allies have repeatedly blamed a clerical culture that places priests and their well-being above lay people.

Speaking to reporters in Rome on Feb. 18, Chicago’s Cardinal Blase Cupich, one of the summit’s organizers, citing academic studies of the abuse crisis in the United States and Australia, said the research has “indicated that homosexuality in itself is not a cause.”

The cardinal, who has previously defended gay priests , added, “It is not as a result of being homosexual that you abuse, as though homosexual people are more prone to abuse children than straight people.”

But emboldened by new waves of revelations of historical abuse, including the recent laicization of the former cardinal Theodore McCarrick, some Catholics have set their sights on gay priests, whom, going against what the findings of experts and a church-commissioned academic study, they blame for the abuse crisis.

Some Catholic organizations and activists are leveling a campaign against gay priests, using the ongoing abuse crisis as a platform.

Recent articles about gay priests have appeared in The New York Times and New York magazine, reigniting a debate about the church’s stand. While Pope Francis has seemed more open to welcoming L.G.B.T. Catholics into the church than his predecessors, he also upheld the church’s official ban on gay priests as recently as last year. In a recent interview , the pope said having gay men serve as priests “is something that worries me” and said that homosexuality is becoming “fashionable” in both society and the church. Deeper analysis of the pope’s words suggested that he was talking about sexually active gay priests and not clerics who abide by their promises of celibacy.

That has not stopped some Catholic organizations and activists from leveling a campaign against gay priests, using the ongoing abuse crisis as a platform.

In a statement released Feb. 20, the U.S.-based Catholic League rejected the idea that a culture of clericalism created conditions ripe for the abuse crisis and, as the organization has done many times in the past, instead pinned it on gay priests.

“The preoccupation with clericalism on the part of so-called progressive Catholics has more to do with their myopia, and their desire to divert attention away from homosexuality, than with a pursuit of the truth,” said the group’s leader, Bill Donohue.

Rhode Island Bishop Thomas Tobin tweeted Feb. 21 that the abuse crisis was caused by a number of factors, including “gay currents in the Church.”

A number of bishops who were not part of the meeting, which was limited mostly to the heads of bishops conferences, also sought to link homosexuality and the abuse crisis ahead of the summit.

Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput wrote in a brief blog post published on Feb. 19 by the National Catholic Register , that while bishops and lay people must work together to ensure abuse is handled correctly, that “predatory homosexuality played a major role in most of the abuse cases we know about.”

Archbishop Chaput’s comments echo those of Cardinal Raymond Burke and Cardinal Walter Brandmuller, who in a letter published Feb. 19 said the “plague of the homosexual agenda has spread within the church” and that it is “protected by a climate of complicity and a conspiracy of silence.”","__label__Neutral"
1986,"Meghan Markle & Prince Harry's Reaction To Friends Talking To The Press Is Understandable","Can Meghan Markle and Prince Harry just have ONE moment of peace? Clearly, the answer to that question is a solid no, because it seems like the Duke and Duchess of Sussex just can't catch a break when it comes to being dragged into the spotlight of the media. While it's completely understandable for two royals to be consistently in the public eye, what's not understandable is the fact that Meghan Markle's strained relationship with her family is being brought up time and time again — and that friends close to the couple may be the people behind the speculation. Honestly, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's reaction to friends talking to the press makes so much sense, and it would be something any average person would do, too.

According to Vanity Fair reporter Katie Nicholl, the drama occurring in Meghan Markle's family has put Prince Harry on high alert, reportedly urging those close to him not to speak with anyone in the media for any reason.

A source told the publication:

They both expect a code of silence. If you talk to the press you’re out. Harry didn’t used to care that much about what was written [in the press], he just said it was a load of shite, but he’s very protective of Meghan and defensive these days.

Elite Daily has reached out to the Palace for comment on the report, but did not hear back by the time of publication.

But it's so understandable why the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are going on lockdown in terms of their friendships. When you have such a private matter, such as family issues, being aired out in public, you want to do everything possible to keep the matter contained.

Royal editor Camilla Tominey told Nicholl that Harry and Meghan have also ""been extremely upset by Thomas Markle’s behavior and that of Meghan’s half-sister, Samantha, and other relatives speaking out to the press. If the royals value one quality in others more than anything else then it is loyalty, and the couple will feel very let down by what’s happened.""

Long story short: If you're friends with Prince Harry and Meghan , then stop the gossip, fam! Despite the fact that these two are literally royalty, they seem like two people who want to be as private and low-key as possible — meaning that staying out of the press is their main goal that unfortunately does not seem attainable anytime soon.

Vanity Fair also reports that the Duke and Duchess will be spending the rest of the summer at a rented farmhouse in the Cotswolds so that they can spend some time out of the spotlight.

A local told the publication:

It’s very clear they want to be private and left alone. The property is in the middle of woodland and you wouldn’t know it was there. It is very remote which is why they like it. It’s like a fortress. There’s a huge security presence, you can’t get close.

So to anyone who wants to try and invade Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's space: Leave. Go. Scram!

Let them enjoy their newlywed bliss on their own, and let's leave their private matters to them, and them only.","__label__Neutral"

2150,"Migrate your UI5Lab library to the new UI5 tooling","UI5Lab is a community driven project to establish a repository for UI5 Custom Control Libraries. It is meant to gather forces throughout the community and enable everyone to use UI5 Custom Controls easily. More information about UI5Lab can be found here:  

So far we have collected more than 20 community libraries and the project has matured quite a bit over the last months. Our initial prototype used grunt and bower to load the UI5 dependencies. Recently, we have switched all UI5Lab repositories  to npm modules and the new UI5 tooling. Thanks @mlauffer, @Stermi, @WittmerJ and @Randombyte for the help!

While the old library structure still works ok, we recommend switching to the new tooling for all community libraries. Bower is deprecated and the new UI5 tools are much simpler to use than grunt.

In this guide, I will explain the simple steps to make it work based on my UI5Lab library openui5.parallax . The same code base is also used for the ui5lab.geometry template library.

Assuming you have followed our UI5Lab documentation to create your library only a few steps are required:

This step is quite simple:

Modify your package.json file to load the npm modules instead of the deprecated bower modules.

Update your .gitignore and .npmignore and throw out those bower paths there, too.

Finally, don’t forget to update your documentation – bower install is not needed anymore in the development setup steps.

Note: If you wish to continue using Grunt, you have to adjust your Gruntfile.js a bit. You can find instructions in this commit . We don’t to it here as we switch to the new UI5 tooling immediately.

Now it is time to switch the server and build too stack as well. We need add the dev dependency to the new UI5 tooling and exchange the start and build scripts. We also add some new ui5lab metadata to the package.json. Finally, we add a ui5.yaml configuration file to the project and adjust the ignore files.

Add a section “ui5lab” and fill in namespace, icon, and display name (for future innovations)

{   ""name"": ""openui5-parallax"",   ""version"": ""1.0.0"",   ""description"": ""A library wrapping parallax.js in UI5 controls to create stunning layered effects"",   ""private"": false,   ""scripts"": {     ""test"": ""echo \""Error: no test specified. Please add some.\"" &amp;&amp; exit 1"",     ""prepare"": ""node prepare"",     ""start"": ""ui5 serve -o"",     ""build"": ""ui5 build""   },   ""ui5lab"": {     ""namespace"": ""openui5.parallax"",     ""icon"": ""dimension"",     ""displayName"": ""Parallax""   },   ""dependencies"": {     ""@openui5/sap.ui.core"": ""^1.60.0"",     ""@openui5/sap.m"": ""^1.60.0"",     ""@openui5/themelib_sap_belize"": ""^1.60.0"",     ""@openui5/sap.ui.layout"": ""^1.60.0"",     ""@openui5/sap.f"": ""^1.60.0"",     ""parallax-js"": ""^3.1.0""   },   ""devDependencies"": {     ""ui5lab-browser"": ""^1.0.0"",     ""@ui5/cli"": ""^0.2.3"",     ""fs-extra"": ""^3.0.0""   } }

Define a library project for the UI5 tooling, apps would use type “application”. This will instruct the tooling to serve resources properly and build a library preload accordingly.

Note: There is additional documentation available on GitHub if you like to do something fancy or need special treatment for your lib. For example, in my libary openui5-parallax i had to define a shim for loading the thirdparty library resources properly. Try the standard way first, if it does not work for your thirdparty dependencies, have a look at my library as a reference.

Add a “prepare.js” file to your root folder – this will enable the new way of loading the UI5Lab browser and fill the libraries.json file automatically with your library namespace once after installation.

var fs = require('fs-extra');  // copy ui5lab browser to the right location for local testing fs.copySync('./node_modules/ui5lab-browser/dist/', './test/ui5lab/browser');  // read library namespace from package.json var oPackage = require('./package.json'); var sNamespace = oPackage.ui5lab.namespace || ""ui5lab.library"";  // add library namespace to browser library list var sBrowserLibraryFile = './test/ui5lab/browser/libraries.json'; fs.readFile(sBrowserLibraryFile, 'utf8', function (err, data) {  if (err) {   return console.log(err);  }  var result = data.replace(/\[((\r)?\n\t)*\]/m, '[\r\n\t\t""' + sNamespace + '""\r\n\t]');  fs.writeFile(sBrowserLibraryFile, result, 'utf8', function (err) {   if (err) return console.log(err);  }); });

Add the line to ignore reference to the UI5Lab browser in your project. If you deliver your library via npm, we recommend to also ignore the dist folder to not clutter your GitHub repo with duplicate files:

A browser should open with the root folder of your library. Be sure to check the library is shown in the local UI5Lab browser and the samples are working fine by checking all entry points

Make sure this file is located in a folder named as your library namespace, in my case “test-resources/openui5/parallax”, otherwise the library cannot be displayed in the browser. Later on, we plan to get rid of this metadata file and switch complelety to package.json – but thats another story.

Make sure the base href is correct. By default, this is 4 times up the folder tree, but it could be different in your library depending on your namespace. This is essential as the central UI5Lab browser  switches your samples to load UI5 from the CDN and defines an additional resource path for your library on the fly . If you don’t define a proper &lt;base href=”…”&gt;, the sample will fail in the UI5Lab-central project.

Note: if you wish to check what will be published, run “npm pack” and check the created archive first. Don’t forget deleting the generated tgz file before publishing, otherwise the tgz file will also be published 

Push your changes to GitHub. If you chose to not publish to npm don’t forget to also push the “dist” folder so that the optimized resources can be loaded in the UI5Lab-central project.

If you publish to npm, you need to edit the package.json in the project UI5Lab-central and update your library to your new version. If you publish to GitHub, just let us know or wait until the next build runs.

If you want to make sure everything works fine, you can test all changes locally by following the instructions in the README.md in UI5Lab-central .

That’s it! Create a pull request, sit back and relax while we review your change.

I hope this guide will help migrating your libraries.

The 36-year-old was admitted to University of California San Francisco Medical Center with heart failure.
The patient had a pacemaker fitted due to a history of poor cardiovascular health, according to the New England Journal of Medicine.
During his first week of treatment, he began coughing violently, according to reports. And in the midst of one coughing fit he hawked up a bronchial tree – a series of tubes that distribute air to the lungs.
The unnamed patient died a week later.
The journal says he had a rare ejection fraction deficiency – a term for how much blood is pumped with each contraction.
His was around 50 percent less than the normal rate.
During the week, he had been coughing up blood and mucus, increasing the strain on his lungs.
Doctors were treating him with oxygen tanks.
You can’t actually cough up a whole human lung, which is too large to fit through the trachea.
But it is possible to cough so violently that parts of the organ pop through spaces between ribs, or to cough up parts.
After the patient coughed up the bronchial tree, he was immediately intubated and doctors performed a bronchoscopy.

804,"Sony opens experimental ‘park’ in Ginza","In what appears to be an unusual mix, tech giant Sony Corp. opened a “park” in the middle of the Tokyo’s ritzy Ginza district on Thursday with four subterranean levels.

Ginza Sony Park was built at the site where the Sony Building, a former landmark, once stood. The ground floor consists of greenery and looks like a standard park, but the four underground floors consist of shops and free space.

Some of the shops sell food and goods, but much of the facility’s 3,807 sq. meters of floor space is designed to let people hang out freely.

“We think such free space is what makes a park,” said Daisuke Nagano, president of Sony Enterprise Co., during a media preview of the facility Wednesday.

The Sony Building, which opened in 1966 and was dismantled last year, was used as a showroom for the company’s products, but Nagano stressed that Ginza Sony Park is neither commercial complex nor showroom.

The basement levels are surrounded by bare concrete, which makes them look like garages, and has pipes and air ducts hanging from their ceilings. Sony said the facility can be used as a space for events.

For now, a roller skating rink has been set up on the second basement floor that can be used for free until Sept. 24.

The idea of Sony opening a park-themed facility may sound odd, but Nagano said it was an experiment before erecting a new Sony building on the site. Sony plans to run the park until fall 2020, when it will start construction on the new Sony Building with an eye to opening it in 2022.

“At first, we were mainly discussing the design of the new building and how we will use it in Sony’s way,” said Nagano.

But with many other companies also developing new buildings in Tokyo by 2020, “We came to think that not creating a building for now actually fits Sony’s way,” since its culture is to do something that others don’t, Nagano explained.

Sony wants to see how the park concept will work out because it hopes to incorporate greater openness into the new Sony Building, he said, adding that another purpose is to enhance Sony’s brand image.

Asked how Sony will make revenue from the park business, Nagano said most of it will come from the shopping and advertising space.

Ginza Sony Park is open from 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. everyday except Jan. 1 and admission is free.","__label__Neutral"
712,"Police seek information following scrub fires","Please attribute to Constable Gregory Nolet:

Wanaka Police are appealing for information following two scrub fires started by people shooting fireworks from a ute early last month.

At around 5.20pm on Friday 2 November, a roman candle-type firework was lit and fired from the passenger side of the ute on State Highway 6 near the Hawea Dam structure.

The firework sparked a scrub fire on the bank on the west side of the road, which quickly spread to a forested area near 5 houses.

It took fire crews including five helicopters with monsoon buckets to extinguish the blaze, thankfully before it reached the houses.

Another roman candle firework was fired from the same vehicle from a car park at Cameron Creek near Makarora on State Highway 6 at around 6.30pm.

This also started a fire in a grass area, which was put out by the people in the ute.

The ute is described as a dark coloured Mitsubishi Triton with a wooden deck.

Four men in their mid 20s were seen in the ute.

This was reckless and dangerous behaviour that put lives and homes at risk.

Police would like to hear from anyone in the area at the time that witnessed the incidents, anyone who can identify the ute or the four men in it.

They are asked to contact the Wanaka Police on (03) 443 7272.

2600,"Fizdale gets creative to break Mitchell Robinson’s bad habits","CLEVELAND — If David Fizdale is doing push-ups on the Garden sidelines during a game, you’ll know rookie shotblocking center Mitchell Robinson has improved his defensive posture.
Fizdale has a fun bet going with Robinson, the Knicks’ second-round project who has been plagued by foul trouble. Robinson’s problems, according to the coaching staff, stem from keeping his hands low and picking up unnecessary reach-in fouls.
So Fizdale has made it a contest.
“We got a little thing now where you guys will catch me sooner or later, but if he doesn’t do the foul where his hands are down, I got to do push-ups,’’ Fizdale said. “And if he does [foul with his hands down,] he has to do push-ups. So, you might see my body change here. For now it’s done just during practices.
“But I told him if he gets a couple of them in a row, I might make [us] do it in front of the whole arena.”
Fizdale had elevated the 7-foot-1 Robinson into the starting lineup after the season’s fifth game, but the 20-year-old wasn’t ready and got supplanted by Enes Kanter 12 games later. He’s back to coming off the bench and overall this season is averaging 4.9 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in 17.6 minutes. This from a player who took a year off from organized basketball after high school to train for the draft.
“There’s no other way to substitute [not] playing for a year, especially at that age,’’ Fizdale said. “That’s a big development year for a young kid — to not be in five-on-five competition for all that time.
“This kid is mature and reliable. When he says he’s going to do something he does it. Comes to work every day. Never gives you attitude. You probably coach him the hardest, cause he’s the most raw out of all of them. He’s a joy to work with though.”
The deadline to convert undrafted rookie Allonzo Trier’s two-way G-League contract is now pushed back about a week from the original Dec. 15 because of his hamstring injury. Trier will travel with the club on the three-game trip to Cleveland, Charlotte and Indiana to rehab. None of those days will count on his 45-day clock.

That means the Knicks don’t have to reach agreement on a new regular contract and they have more time to decide who to cut to make room for Trier on the 15-man roster. The candidates are guard Ron Baker and center Luke Kornet. The Knicks could keep Baker to package in a larger deal for mathematical cap purposes as he’s worth $4.5 million. Also, trade talks should heat up Saturday because 2018 free agents become eligible to be moved.
Courtney Lee, back from his neck injury, has played three games and 26 minutes, but needs more playing time to get back into condition. Hence, Lee requested to play at least one G-League game with Westchester, starting with Wednesday’s contest in Lakeland, Fla. Lee, 33, will rejoin the Knicks in Charlotte.
“That was his decision,’’ Fizdale said. “I was like, ‘What a pro.’ The fact he came to us and said I’m hurting the guys, I have no legs and I have no rhythm. If it’s OK, can I go to the G-League and play some minutes.’’
The Knicks ultimately would like to showcase Lee to trade his long-term pact but Lee admitted Friday he’s in preseason form.
“It’ll probably take couple of weeks to get back get a rhythm and feel chemistry with the guys,’’ Lee said.","__label__Positive"

2411,"Kyle Busch wins fourth consecutive Gander Trucks race at Texas - NASCAR","FORT WORTH, Texas — Kyle Busch continued his winning ways out west.
Busch held off Stewart Friesen by 1.269-seconds for his fourth-consecutive NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series victory of the season and his fourth-career win at Texas Motor Speedway.
Busch led a race-high 97 laps in the Vankor 350 en route to his 55th career series win and his 202nd among NASCAR’s top three national series.
“Those guys were able to keep up with us just way too much throughout the night,” Busch said. “You know, it’s a better race that way when they’re able to keep up. That means we need to go to work and work harder in order to get ourselves faster.”
Johnny Sauter, Grant Enfinger, Matt Crafton, Tyler Ankrum, Ross Chastain, Tyler Dippel, Brennan Poole and Ben Rhodes rounded out the top 10 finishers. The race was slowed by 10 cautions—tying the series track record.
Enfinger led the field to green. Stage 1 was slowed by four cautions the first involving Todd Gilliland, Chastain and Brennan Poole coming out of Turn 4 on Lap 3. Gilliland slid through the front stretch grass but continued on.
Harrison Burton, who started 10th, spun into the Turn 1 wall on Lap 11.
“I got loose on corner entry and just lost it,” said Burton, who finished 31st. “Happy I’m ok. Happy I’ve got a good team behind me.
Angela Ruch and Gus Dean triggered the third caution in Turn 2 on Lap 18. Dean’s damage was too much to overcome. He wrecked again on Lap 26 and called it a night.
Enfinger won his first stage of the season. He beat ThorSport Racing teammate Ben Rhodes to the line by .034-seconds. However, a pit road penalty mired Enfinger in the back of the pack and he spent the next two stages working his way forward.
“This was our first normal race of the season,” Enfinger told the No. 98 ThorSport team following his third top-five finish of the season. “Let’s keep doing this and the wins will come.”
Busch inherited the lead to start Stage 2 on Lap 42. Six laps later, Anthony Alfredo, who restarted sixth, lost control of his truck following contact with Stewart Friesen entering Turn 1. The No. 54 truck hit the wall and erupted into flames. NASCAR red-flagged the race for 15:51. Busch remained on the point with Crafton, Chastain, Bubba Wallace and Brett Moffitt in tow for the Lap 57 restart. Busch held on for his sixth stage win in 2019.
With a fuel-only pit stop, Sauter took the lead out of the pits on Lap 75. He quickly faded allowing Busch to regain the lead followed by Moffitt. Moffitt barreled past Busch on the outside exiting Turn 2 on Lap 99 with Rhodes, Friesen and Enfinger in pursuit. Four laps later, Korbin Forrister spun in Turn 2 to ignite the ninth caution.
Busch held the lead through the 10th and final caution on Lap 116. Friesen, who started from the rear after an engine change, battled Busch on the final restart. Although it took Friesen 10 laps to lead one circuit, his time at the point was short-lived. He would settle for second—the fifth runner-up result of his career.
“The last couple of laps were just mad,” Friesen said after his best finish of the year. “We were just tight. I just got loose underneath him. He gave me some room. Originally, I thought he was right there on my quarter. But he was doing what he had to do. After that, I was just tight. Proud of my guys. Proud of Halmar. Man, just a bummer. I thought we could have got him if we had got cleared.”
With 21 laps to go, Moffitt made contact with Rhodes battling for fourth, causing his left rear tire to go flat. Although Moffitt kept the No. 24 Chevrolet off the wall, he was forced to pit for tires and dropped to 19th, two laps off the pace.
“The No. 24 (Moffitt) was who I was really worried about and then something happened to him and then (Friesen) was really fast and on our tailgate the whole finish of that race until about the last five laps,” Busch said.
“I don’t know if he just got heated up or what back there. He put up a good fight and about got to me a couple times there and fortunately I was able to hold out and keep this truck up front. We just lacked a little bit of overall speed tonight and we didn’t have exactly what we wanted.”
Busch returned to the lead with 20 laps to go and held the point to the finish. Friesen leads the Gander Outdoors Truck Series standings by six points over Grant Enfinger.","__label__Positive"

With a larger business backing us, we will be able to tackle ambitious projects and grow Bowerbank Ninow in ways that were not previously possible. We view these changes as a natural extension of our desire to continue to improve our business and share our vision. As a part of these changes, we will also be moving to exciting new premises with significantly increased exhibition space.
So, what is going to change and what does this mean?
Firstly and most importantly, there will be no immediate changes. Auction N12 and Auction N13 will go ahead as planned, beginning at 6:30pm on Wednesday, April 3. Likewise, the exhibition program will continue in the current space until June, when the gallery will be moving to its new home.
Simon and Charles will still be overseeing the day-to-day operations of the business, and will remain in positions similar to those they currently hold, with Simon Bowerbank overseeing Webb’s and Bowerbank Ninow’s exhibition program as a continuation of his current role as Gallery Director, while Charles will be overseeing the Fine Art Department at Webb’s. This means that any consignments that have previously been discussed will still be sold in future auctions, and any existing contracts concerning works are still valid. Likewise, works held in the Bowerbank Ninow stockroom can still be stored or collected as per existing contracts and agreements.
We are excited about working on new exhibitions with our current artists and developing new projects and relationships. We are also looking forward to the ability a new space will give us to mount larger-scale exhibitions and projects, or to run multiple exhibitions concurrently.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the state Bureau of Investigation believes 70-year-old Percy Hodges was storing the bodies until they were claimed or funeral arrangements were made.

Hodges told authorities the bodies were stored in the 1980s or 1990s. The GBI is now asking for information on the bodies identified as Theresa McClarin, Leroy Dixon and Mamie Fredricks.

The GBI says a crew removing the shed last month found two containers and a casket that they tried to sell at a scrap yard. But one item opened while being offloaded and revealed human bones.

1259,"Sore joints, unable to walk: the reality of living with arthritis, aged 8","Eight-year-old Esme Stewart-Smith could barely walk when she woke up one day in July 2016 with sore knees and a fever.  The Auckland girl was on holiday with her family at the time, and her mother Kylie Stewart had to carry her onto the plane home because she was in so much pain. More than a year of doctors visits later, she and her family was shocked to learn she had arthritis – a condition they previously dismissed as a disease for the elderly.   Esme is one of 647,000 New Zealanders living with the condition, which causes inflammation of the joints, leading to pain and stiffness. READ MORE: * Chemotherapy for arthritis a weekly reality for Lower Hutt girl * Brave teenager battles daily pain of arthritis * Painful arthritis learning for Ava's parents * When an old person's disease strikes the young When Stewart first heard the word 'arthritis' mentioned in their quest for a diagnosis, she dismissed it.   ""It wasn't on our radar whatsoever."" Juvenile arthritis is a children's auto-immune disease that causes joint tissue to swell.  Esme's pain comes in waves and it can flare up any time. She recently spent two nights in hospital with swollen knees and a rash.    ""It's not been great. At the end of last year, she missed a lot of school,"" Stewart said.  ""When it's bad, she finds it hard to walk, climb up stairs and hop in the car."" As a result of the arthritis, Esme had also developed complex pain syndrome.   ""She's been in pain for so long that it doesn't want to turn off."" Sunnybrae Normal School, where Esme is a pupil, allows her to have a half day on a Wednesday to give her a mid-week rest. ""I never know when I'm going to have [a flare-up],"" Esme said. Stewart said the diagnosis had had an impact on family life, especially as her husband, Rick Smith, was in the Navy and wasn't always around. ""We used to go on summer walks as a family. When she is sore, we can't go out or do anything really."" For the most part, Esme takes it in her stride. Instructed by her doctor to keep active, she wears a watch to count her steps – her daily goal is 5000. She recently restarted school PE lessons and can play half of a netball game, despite starting to feel stiffness in her fingers and elbows. Esme said she wanted to be treated the same as other children, with exceptions for when she was in pain. Arthritis New Zealand chief executive Philip Kearney said the number of New Zealanders diagnosed with arthritis was predicted to reach one million by 2040. The Ministry of Health does not collect data on the number of children living with arthritis, which makes planning for the care of children with arthritis more challenging, he said.

1451,"What’s Ruining Your Sex Life?","What’s Ruining Your Sex Life?

Sexuality  invites us to be in the moment, connected to our body, our senses, and to another person. Yet having a “ critical inner voice ” sounding off in our minds during sex is a little like having an extra person in the room critiquing everything from desirability to performance. These critical inner voices take us out of the experience, remove us from our bodies and leave us disconnected from our partner, robbing us of the precious aspects of sexuality.

It’s probably no surprise to hear that research has shown that having higher self-esteem and a more positive body image is correlated with increased sexual satisfaction. On the other hand, negative thoughts toward ourselves heighten our stress levels, which can decrease sexual satisfaction . One recent study showed that measures of self-esteem, autonomy, and empathy were positively associated with sexual pleasure, while other research has revealed that people with low self-esteem may also perceive their partners in a more negative light. What all this tells us is that our ability to see ourselves and our partner through kind, empathic eyes has a big impact on how much we enjoy sex.

One of the main culprits guiding us into a negative head space during sex is our critical inner voice . The critical inner voice is a destructive thought process that sabotages our sexual satisfaction. The extent to which we listen to this “voice” correlates with our feelings of self-consciousness, insecurity, and shame . It can also lead to self-limiting, or even self-destructive, behavior.  While most of us know that the buzzing sound of our self-critical thoughts can be a major buzzkill when it comes to sex, we aren’t always fully aware of how much this voice affects us.

Years ago, when researching for the book Conquer Your Critical Inner Voice , my colleagues and I interviewed individuals and couples about the critical thoughts they experienced around sexuality. We found that many people had critical inner voices about themselves or their partner or about sex in general before, during, and after sex. On the one hand, we found the presence of such thoughts to be expected and relatable. After all, a person’s sexuality is very personal, and it can feel fairly vulnerable to be open to another person. On the other hand, we were struck by the degree of cruelty in the voices people expressed as well as the painful emotions that often accompanied  them.

One common way people can be very unkind to themselves and their sexuality is in the critical inner voices they have toward their bodies. Common examples I’ve heard include:

You look terrible naked. It’s humiliating to take off your clothes.

Your penis is too small, she will not be satisfied. She’s going to laugh at you.

You look so old. She isn’t attracted to you anymore.

He’s going to see how ugly you really are.

A lot of critical inner voices surface in anticipation of being sexual. Many people have described having thoughts like:

Do you really think he is attracted to you? Why would he be?

You’re going to be so awkward. She’s going to lose interest.

He won’t like you anymore if you sleep with him.

Why are you thinking about sex again? Are you some kind of pervert?

Watch out, he’s probably just using you.

You’re going to embarrass yourself.

She’d rather be with someone else.

You shouldn’t pursue sex. You’ll just be rejected.

It’s gross to want sex.

You won’t know what to do.

Many people have critical inner voices during sex that remove them from being in the moment. Mean attacks start to creep in that are directed toward themselves, their performance, their partner, or toward sex in general that stop them from enjoying the experience.

You’re not making her feel good.

You should be doing this or that.

He’s probably turned off by you.

You’re so bad at this.

She doesn’t seem that excited.

You won’t be able to finish.

You’re going to finish too quickly.

Don’t show him/her what you want. You’ll look like a freak.

Why can’t he/she tell what you want?

He/she thinks you’re terrible at this.

Can’t he tell you’re not feeling anything?

These kinds of thoughts make sex far less enjoyable. For one thing, they take us out of the free flow of the experience and causes us distress, but they also disconnect us and sometimes even alienate us from our partner. Oftentimes, when one person starts to listen to their critical inner voice during sex, their partner notices a change. The sign of one person seeming distracted or slightly less enthusiastic can then trigger the other person’s critical inner voice. “Wait, what changed? What did you do wrong?”

Many couples describe how once they start listening to their critical inner voice, sex becomes more mechanical, not a shared personal experience. However, even when they’re able to ward off their inner critic during sex, they may notice voices creeping in after sex. After being sexual, people have described having thoughts like:

He/she didn’t seem that into you.

You were too excited. He/she probably thinks you’re desperate.

He/she’s not going to want to be with you again.

So what if you felt good, this one time? It won’t be that way next time.

Whatever our specific voices may be in relation to sex, the solution remains the same. To feel free and ourselves in relation to our sexuality, we have to challenge this inner critic. Here are some steps you can take to start to challenge your own inner critic:

1) Write the “voices” down: The first step is to write down all of the negative thoughts you have in relation to your sexuality. These can be thoughts about your body, your performance, your partner, or sex in general. When you do this, you should write your voices in the second person, as if someone is saying them to you. For example, instead of saying, “I’m just bad at sex,” you would write, “You are just bad at sex.”

2) Explore the roots of your attitudes: Oftentimes, when people start listing what their voices say, more and more start to come to mind. It can feel like being flooded with critical commentary. Sometimes, the attack will start specific, but as you continue writing, deeper, more rooted attitudes about sexuality start to surface.

For example, one woman started out by writing, “Sex is too complicated. It just isn’t for you.” As she got further into her list of voices, she wrote things like, “Sex is dangerous. It’s dirty. You’re going to get a disease. It’s gross to want sex. Good girls shouldn’t want sex.” Although, she wasn’t as aware of these critical inner voices in her present life, she recognized some of the thoughts as exact phrases her mother had said to her about sex when she was growing up.

Just like our critical inner voices, our attitudes about sexuality often come from our past. Whether they were direct things said to us, as in the case of the woman mentioned, or attitudes and beliefs we picked up on, these forces help mold our sense of our own sexuality. Making connections to where our negative attitudes come from can help us separate these feelings from our past from our real point of view in the present.

3) Respond to each voice attack: After writing down your voices, you should go back to each and every attack and respond from a compassionate, realistic perspective. Try to talk to yourself the way you would a friend . This time, write your responses in the first-person to identify these expressions as your true point of view. For example, if you wrote down the attack, “You are so awkward. No one would want to be sexual with you,” you may write the response, “I may feel awkward when I’m listening to all these voices, but I’m actually a comfortable, affectionate person. When I’m relaxed, I like how I am sexually.”

4) Discover your own attitude toward sex: As you peel away the overlays of your inner critic, try to have an open and welcoming attitude toward your real feelings about sex, whatever they may be. This is the time to let go of all the “should’s” and discover what you really enjoy and desire. Try to have a curious, open, and nonjudgmental perspective toward yourself. Have self-compassion for any experiences that may have hurt you in relation to your sexuality. Do not let your inner critic convince you that you have to limit, restrict, or punish yourself based on those experiences. Remember your sexuality belongs to you. It is yours to understand, explore, and enjoy.

5) Open up to your partner: If you’re in a trusting relationship, you may want to talk to your partner about how your critical inner voice attacks your sexuality. This may feel uncomfortable at first, but being open and vulnerable often inspires your partner to do the same and brings you both closer on a deeper level. By sharing your insights and what’s going on in your head, you allow your partner to really know you and to understand the aspects of your sexuality that may have little to do with them. This may help them to not attack themselves as much in relation to their sexuality. Talking openly in this way can benefit your relationship, but studies also show that couples who can get to be comfortable talking about sex actually enjoy sex more.

Kicking your critical inner voice out of the bedroom may seem easier said than done, but continuing to be aware of your voices and how they affect your sexuality is something that can benefit you throughout your life. It can help you have more fun in casual situations and enjoy more lasting intimacy and closeness in a long-term relationship. Being alive to your sexuality is a practice in maintaining an important part of who you are. One of the most effective ways to do this is to keep challenging your inner critic and exploring your own, real feelings about your sexuality.

2392,"What’s next for Triple Crown champs American Pharoah, Justify","With no Triple Crown on the line in the 151st Belmont Stakes on Saturday at Belmont Park, racing fans are looking to the progeny of American Pharoah and Justify to provide the next superstar capable of the historic sweep.

They might — or might not — be rewarded.

American Pharoah ended a record 37-year drought between Triple Crown winners when he swept the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont in 2015. He went a step farther by becoming the first 3-year-old to complete the Grand Slam when he dominated the Breeders’ Cup Classic to end a sensational career.

Justify emerged last year as the 13th Triple Crown champion, the only one to be retired undefeated. He captured all six starts in a dizzying span that extended from his Feb. 18 debut through the mile-and-a-half Belmont. His enormous value as a stallion prompted his retirement at the end of July with what was described as a nagging ankle injury.

Both are part of a star-studded stallion roster at Ashford Stud in Versailles, Ky., though their duties hardly end there. They will jet to Australia to be paired with some of the most accomplished mares in that part of the world in July. Each is likely to produce more than 250 foals per year in the early going.

“If the Triple Crown is ever going to be achieved again,” said Dermot Ryan, manager of Ashford Stud, “American Pharoah and Justify are in great position to sire the winner, having done it themselves.”

Breeders are investing heavily with that hope. When American Pharoah was sent to the breeding shed, his stud fee was set at $200,000 per pop. A date with Justify is only slightly less costly, at $150,000.

The return is anything but certain in an industry that lives by the credo, “Breed the best to the best — and hope for the best.”

The gaudy credentials of American Pharoah and Justify do not guarantee anything. Bob Baffert, the Hall of Fame trainer whose brilliance

contributed greatly to their success, is keenly aware of that.

“You don’t know who’s going to be a good sire,” he said.

One of the enduring beauties of the “Sport of Kings” is that success cannot be bought. Seattle Slew, the 1977 Triple Crown winner, was purchased for $17,500.

“Sometimes we overthink it and, in this business, you can’t overthink it,” Baffert said. “Keep it simple. Breed the fastest to the fastest you can afford and just hope it works out.”

Early returns on American Pharoah are extremely encouraging. His first runner, Monarch of Egypt, made a winning debut in Ireland. He registered his first North American winner with Maven on April 19 at Aqueduct. Both are being pointed toward the prestigious Royal Ascot meet in England later this month.

Ahmed Zayat owned American Pharoah before selling his breeding rights to Coolmore America for a reported $13.8 million. He is as excited about his offspring as he was when American Pharoah was strutting his stuff on the track.

“If the 2-year-olds of American Pharoah run to their looks, the sky is the limit,” he said. “The majority of them have an unbelievable mind but, more significantly, they are awesome movers like their dad.” At last count, Zayat owned 12 of American Pharoah’s foals.

Coolmore America was so jazzed by Justify that it paid a reported $65 million to secure the only Triple Crown winner that did not gain valuable experience by racing at 2 years old.

“The manner in which he won it,” Ryan said, “is something that has never been seen before and will likely never be seen again.”

Veteran bloodstock agent Eugenio Colombo worries the fragility that delayed the start of Justify’s career might be passed on. He calls American Pharoah a “better racing machine.”

The only certainty in all of this is that both stallions have a rather satisfying lifestyle.","__label__Positive"

Yesterday, Mahathir, who is also Bersatu chairperson, was reported to have said that the party had agreed to open its branch in Sabah.

He said the decision was to provide an avenue for former Umno members who do not wish to join Warisan, to join Bersatu.

They also say that a political party that bases its election campaign around increasing, or introducing new taxes is destined for the opposition benches. As the current government is intending to do precisely that with the introduction of a capital gains tax, we will see how true that saying turns out to be. The taxation system in this country is already unfair and the introduction of some of Michael Cullen’s proposed new taxes will not make the tax system fairer. It will just mean that the same people pay more tax than ever. Peter Williams commented on this just before Christmas. quote.  Last year $77.5b was collected in taxes. Individuals paid $35b in income tax, together we paid $20.5b in GST and companies chipped in $13b.There was just under $7b from customs, excise and road user charges, and over $2b taken from tax on bank interest and company dividends.So it’s pretty darn hard to do anything these days without being taxed.What’s more, according to figures from last year, 48 per cent of that income tax is paid by just 11 per cent of taxpayers, those earning more than $90,000 a year. 

 

Yet 82 per cent of taxpayers, earning up to $70,000 a year, pay less than 40 per cent of the total income tax take.   When you consider that many of those earning up to $70,000 get tax credits and accommodation supplements, about one in four households pays no net income tax at all. 

 

Peter Williams      Our income tax regime takes from the high earners and gives to the low earners. That’s what a compassionate and generous society does.But according to this Government, our tax system isn’t fair.Therefore we need to be taxed in different ways. The Tax Working Group (TWG), chaired by Sir Michael Cullen, is determined to introduce a Capital Gains Tax (CGT). end quote.   It is Cullen’s intention that CGT will be legislated before the next election, but effective after the election. In other words, assuming National campaigns successfully on getting rid of the tax, they will have to repeal the legislation. Not impossible, of course, but this is dishonesty on the part of a government that promised no new taxes unless mandated by a successful election. No surprises there. quote.   The final report of the TWG is due late next month. But it’s patently obvious they want to tax your assets either when you sell them, or as those assets increase in value over time. It could be said with some certainty that if a CGT is passed into law before the next election, that election will be about CGT and not much else. The major problem though is that most of your assets either won’t be taxed, or already are. The family home accounts for about 42 per cent of the average family’s net wealth. No government has the political courage to tax the increases in value of your house. The family home will not be taxed.Another 14 per cent of household wealth is in fixed interest investments like bank deposits. They’re already taxed. end quote.  Because of exemptions, such as the family home, CGT collected little revenue for about 15 years after its introduction in Australia. You can expect a similar outcome here. Markets always react to change, and the property market will react initially, probably pushing prices downwards. It may not only be the property market either. quote.   There’s our KiwiSaver accounts. But for the Government to even consider touching them for more tax would be outrageous. The money both we and our employer pay into KiwiSaver has already been taxed.  What could be taxed then? It looks like investment property, holiday homes and New Zealand shares held directly by individuals in either listed or private companies.Put a tax on rental property and the outcome will be higher rents.Put a tax on individuals’ share trading gains and investors will bail out to managed funds where the tax rates are lower. That will hurt the New Zealand sharemarket with serious implications for New Zealand business. end quote. end quote.  The NZX is already a small market, with few IPOs on offer these days. Many large companies now look to dual list with the ASX, or even delist on the NZX all together. Capital gains tax could do a lot of damage to our vulnerable share market; a consequence that I doubt has been properly considered.quote.   Tax the capital gain on the sale of a private business and you take away the incentive to invest and grow the business. Tax the increase in value of a business each year and business owners won’t have much incentive to grow the company, let alone the cash flow to pay the tax. end quote.  Ah yes. Cullen’s much favoured tax on unrealised gains. We already have this on overseas investments (introduced, funnily enough, when Cullen was the Minister of Finance) so he might as well finish the job and tax all unrealised business gains. This is his intention.quote.   The TWG says whatever it comes up with, it must be fiscally neutral. In other words, the total tax take must be no higher than what it is now.But is there any mention of personal income cuts in the TWG reports so far?Nope.Has a Labour government ever dropped income taxes? Well, they did in the 1980s, but that was a Labour government like no other, and certainly not like this one.Is there any suggestion GST will be lowered? The TWG says that won’t happen.Will company tax drop? The first TWG first report said that won’t happen either.It doesn’t sound very fiscally neutral so far.You see where this is heading?Nowhere. end quote.  Of course it is not going to be fiscally neutral. Labour likes to tax the hell out of people and then spend it all on social programmes that don’t work. It is classic Labour ideology, and Michael Cullen has operated on this agenda for decades. Remember his comment about ‘rich pricks’ which was aimed squarely at John Key? It is the politics of envy, pure and simple.  In the 2014 election campaign, John Key made short work of David Cunliffe when he pointed out that capital gains tax would be levied on holiday homes, a property that has passed to a taxpayer on death, and probably also on property owned by trusts. It destroyed Labour’s chances of re-election that year but Labour ideology is strong. Michael Cullen will not rest until he has implemented a capital gains tax, capital transfer tax and wealth tax in some form. That will show the ‘rich pricks’, won’t it?

1657,"Zespri Chairman Peter McBride announces retirement","Peter McBride, who has chaired the Board of Zespri since 2013, will step down as Chairman of Zespri in February 2019 and will retire as a director of Zespri at the company’s next Annual Meeting in July 2019.

The Board of Zespri confirms that Deputy Chairman Bruce Cameron will become Chairman in February 2019. Mr Cameron is a long-time kiwifruit grower and has been a director of Zespri since 2010. The succession provides for continued strong leadership and experience on the Board.

Mr McBride has been a director of Zespri since 2002 and has served as Chairman during a period of change and expansion. This includes the industry’s return to growth following the impact of Psa. He has overseen a premium brand-led strategy and the expansion of Zespri SunGold to meet burgeoning demand in the markets. It has also been a time of progress in strengthening grower ownership and control of Zespri, achieved through industry consultation, change to the Kiwifruit Export Regulations, change to Zespri’s Constitution and a targeted share offer and buy back that was completed this month.

Mr McBride’s tenure as Chairman from 2013 has seen growth in average per hectare returns across all kiwifruit varieties of 55 percent, and growth in the share price from 50 cents in March 2013 to over $8.00 a share.

Reflecting on his Chairmanship, Mr McBride says it has been a privilege serving an industry that has shown strength through its cooperative spirit.

“Our kiwifruit industry has stepped through a number of challenges but we have demonstrated time and time again the cohesiveness of our industry and our ability to act in its common interest. I have been in a fortunate position to see through significant changes and as a kiwifruit grower I am looking forward to Zespri’s continued success as it transforms to serve more and more customers around the world.”

Zespri Director Jonathan Mason comments, “Peter has been an outstanding Chairman for Zespri and a leader in the kiwifruit industry. Among his achievements as both Chairman and director was his leadership in supporting the industry’s recovery from the serious challenge of Psa – communicating and listening to growers and developing the response. He then saw through the execution of our product and market strategy, in response to Psa, with the expansion of SunGold and strong sustainable performance for Green contributing to record returns for the industry. He leaves behind a strong legacy.”

Mr McBride will be formally acknowledged for his outstanding contribution to Zespri and the New Zealand Kiwifruit Industry at the Annual Meeting next year.

•        Peter’s career has focussed on agribusiness development and management in the New Zealand kiwifruit and dairy industries. As well as being an investor in the kiwifruit and dairy industries, Peter has interests in the New Zealand avocado and forest products sectors.

•        Peter represents Zespri International as a Director on the New Zealand International Business Forum and as a member of the New Zealand – China Council.

•        Peter has a long history of service to charitable organisations. He was a former director of Longview Charitable Trust Board (Dairy) in the Waikato and has been a Director of Centrefarm Aboriginal Horticulture in Australia since 2008.  He is also currently the CEO of Trinity Lands Ltd, a large scale dairy and kiwifruit charitable trust.

•        As well as his agribusiness background, Peter’s horticultural science experience has led him to have a strong interest and governance focus on innovation in the New Zealand kiwifruit industry, including serving as Chairman of Kiwifruit Vine Health from 2011 to 2013, in response to the outbreak of Psa in New Zealand.

1596,"Childhood Trauma Exposure Is All Too Common","A long-term study of 1,420 people finds that childhood trauma is more commonplace than is often assumed, and that its effects upon the transition to adulthood and adult functioning are not only confined to post- traumatic stress symptoms and depression but are more broadly based.

These conclusions were reported November 9, 2018 by a team led by 2009 BBRF Young Investigator William E. Copeland, Ph.D., of the Vermont Center for Children, Youth and Families at the University of Vermont. He and his colleagues are part of The Great Smoky Mountain Study, a study of children in 11 mainly rural counties in North Carolina.

Beginning in 1993 and continuing through 2015, the study annually observed 1,420 children, selected randomly from a group of 12,000 local children, through age 16, and again when they reached ages 19, 21, 25 and 30. Results are based on analysis of over 11,000 individual interviews. The sample was designed to over-represent frequently overlooked rural and Native American communities.

One striking perspective emerging from the study is that “it is a myth to believe that childhood trauma is a rare experience that only affects few,” the researchers say. Rather, their population sample suggests, “it is a normative experience—it affects the majority of children at some point.” A surprising 60 percent of those in the study were exposed to at least one trauma by age 16. Over 30 percent were exposed to multiple traumatic events.

“Trauma” for the purpose of the study included violent events (violent death of a loved one, physical abuse or harm, war or terrorism, captivity); sexual trauma; witnessing a trauma that caused or could have caused death or severe injury; learning about a traumatic event involving a loved one; and other traumas such as diagnosis with a serious illness, serious injury, or fire.

“Our study suggested that childhood trauma casts a long and wide-ranging shadow,” the researchers say, associated with elevated risk for many adult psychiatric disorders affecting many “important domains of functioning,” with impacts in the form of diminished health , financial and academic success, and social life .

The impact of trauma across the lifespan has been noted in many past studies. The newly reported study, appearing on the website of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), differed because it followed children from year to year. Prior studies relied upon memory -based reports of childhood events made by participants during their adulthood, which tend to be less accurate. The new study also statistically compensated for the presence of other childhood factors that often co-occur with childhood trauma such as poverty and family instability or dysfunction.

The researchers say their results are consistent with an “accumulation” model of trauma that assigns increased lifetime risk of psychosocial impact with each additional traumatic exposure during childhood. While they do not shed light on the question of which children are more likely to experience trauma, the team hopes the results will inform public policy, via “interventions or policies that broadly target this largely preventable cluster of childhood experiences.”

The research team included: E. Jane Costello, Ph.D., 2009 Ruane Prizewinner and 2007 BBRF Distinguished Investigator; and Edwin J.C.G. van den Oord, Ph.D., 2002 BBRF Independent Investigator.","__label__Neutral"
706,"Bungalowgate - I applied the law without fear or favour, says DPP","Bungalowgate - I applied the law without fear or favour, says DPP

The Attorney-General's Chambers has dismissed suggestions that its decision to drop the corruption case against Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng was politically motivated, or that Attorney-General Tommy Thomas was involved in the decision.

Appellate and Trial Division/Deputy Public Prosecutor head Mohamad Hanafiah Zakaria said it was he that decided to drop the charge against Lim and businessperson Phang Li Koon after being tasked with deciding on representations made by both accused.

Prior to this, Hanafiah did not participate in the case in any way.

""I wish to stress that I have decided on the representations without any influence from any quarters. In fact, there was a letter from a legal firm representing the complainant in the above-said case objecting to any idea of withdrawing the charges against Lim Guan Eng and Phang Li Koon.

""I have responded to the letter that I will decide the case based on available evidence and governing law, which I did, without fear or favour. My utmost priority is justice,"" he said in a statement today.

Below is Hanafiah's statement in full:

1. I would like to clarify that the Hon Attorney-General had no hand in the decision to enter nolle prosequi (where Public Prosecutor does not propose further to prosecute the accused) on the charges against Lim Guan Eng and Phang Li Koon. This is clearly stated in the joint press release dated 2nd August 2018 by the Solicitor-General Datuk Engku Nor Faizah binti Engku Atek and the then Solicitor-General II Datin Paduka Zauyah Be binti T Loth Khan that the Hon Attorney General has recused himself in all deliberations regarding the above-said case, and will not be involved in any decision the AGC will decide in the above-said case.

2. AGC has adopted the ""fresh eye"" technique, and I was tasked to decide on the representations made by both Lim Guan Eng and Phang Li Koon's case as I had not participated in any way with the case earlier. Accordingly, I was able to consider the matter with a fresh perspective.

3. Having given the said task, I have perused the evidence that has been investigated by MACC and the evidence that have been adduced and tested under cross-examination thus far, I concluded that as a result of the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses who have testified so far, the evidence supporting the first charge under Section 23 of the MACC Act and under Section 165 of the Penal Code has been substantially weakened. This conclusion was arrived at in light of fresh evidence that have arisen during the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses.

4. Having made the above findings, I opined that I would not be fulfilling my duties as Deputy Public Prosecutor to let the case continue knowing full well that the case against both Lim Guan Eng and Phang Li Koon would not succeed at the end of the prosecution case. Hence, I decided for the prosecution to enter nolle prosequi against both Lim Guan Eng and Phang Li Koon in accordance with Section 254 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

5. Yesterday at 7.18am, I communicated my decision to Dato' Masri Mohd Daud, who is the Director of Legal and Prosecution Division of MACC and a Deputy Public Prosecutor, who was at that time in Penang. In spite of the Prosecution request for the Court to order a ""discharge not amounting to acquittal"", the Court made an order for a discharge and acquittal. This was upon the application of the Counsel for the accused and was in accordance to section 254(3) of the CPC.

6. I wish to reiterate that the practice to enter nolle prosequi is not something out of the ordinary. This practice has been exercised in many other cases upon representation by counsel and upon discovery of fresh evidence or that the evidence has weakened under cross-examination. Similarly, in the case against Lim Guan Eng and Phang Li Koon, there was fresh evidence that has not been previously considered.

7. It ought to be emphasised that the decision in respect of initiating prosecution or discontinuing it is a matter within the prerogative and powers of the Public Prosecutor. In this case, I kept confidential my decision until the very last minute and did not consult the investigative agency fearing it might leak and cause unnecessary alarm. In fact, my decision was so confidential that I only informed the AG personally at 9.44am yesterday.

8. I wish to stress that I have decided the representations without any influence from any quarters. In fact, there was a letter from a legal firm representing the complainant in the above-said case objecting to any idea of withdrawing the charges against Lim Guan Eng and Phang Li Koon. I have responded to the letter that I will decide the case based on available evidence and governing law, which I did, without fear or favour.

9. My utmost priority is justice.","__label__Neutral"
1817,"Why being seen as tough on Pakistan helps India's Modi - CNN","Tensions between India and Pakistan, already on the rise since mid-February, spiked in the most dramatic of ways on Tuesday, with Delhi saying it had launched airstrikes on what it alleged was a terrorist training camp across its de facto border with Islamabad.

The announcement -- disputed by Pakistan, which says Indian jets did fly across the de facto border, but were pushed back by its forces -- comes less than two weeks after 40 Indian paramilitaries were killed in a devastating car bomb attack in the Kashmir region that has been a source of discord between the two nuclear armed neighbors for decades.

India said the attack was the handiwork of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a Pakistan based terror group, and accused Pakistan of having a ""direct hand"" in the atrocity, a claim denied by Islamabad.

Tuesday's airstrikes were Delhi's response: India says the camp it targeted was run by JeM.

""Credible intelligence was received that JeM was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country... In the face of imminent danger,  a preemptive strike became absolutely necessary,"" India's foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, told reporters in Delhi.

The discrepancy between Delhi's account and what Pakistan is saying isn't novel.

Back in 2016, following an attack on an Indian military installation in Kashmir that India blamed on Pakistan-based gunmen, Delhi carried out what it called "" surgical strikes "" -- sending troops across the de facto border to hit terrorist targets.

Pakistan, however, denied that any such incursion had taken place, saying instead that there had only been an exchange of fire between the two sides.

The upshot: Tensions were eventually contained. Pakistan's leadership denied India's story. India's leadership, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, pressed on with their account to fire up its nationalist domestic base.

This time round, while it remains unclear whether hostilities will escalate in the coming days, the two different accounts from the two countries mean that there could be room, in theory, for tensions to ease.

Domestically, being seen as tough on Pakistan helps Modi politically at a crucial time.

India's election authorities are due within weeks to announce the dates of the next general election.

In 2014, when Modi first became prime minister, he promised to, among other things, revive a flagging economy and be stronger than his predecessors on defense. On the economic front, things have been looking shaky of late .

Even as India's growth remains strong, worries have been mounting for months about a worsening jobs crisis and falling farmer incomes -- both among the factors cited by analysts to explain why Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) suffered heavy losses in a series of important state level polls in December.

But Tuesday's news boosts Modi's image as being strong on defense. And his backers are already seizing on the developments, with Amit Shah, the BJP president, tweeting that Tuesday's ""action further demonstrates that India is safe and secure under the strong &amp; decisive leadership"" of Modi.

Politically, then, this could strengthen Modi as India heads to the polls. Geopolitically, the risk of escalation remains real.","__label__Neutral"

The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2019, said a statement.

Battersea Phase 2 Holding Company Ltd (Battersea Phase 2 Holdco) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Battersea Project Holding Co Ltd, which is owned by Sime Darby Property and SP Setia, each holding a 40 percent stake, and the EPF the remaining 20 per cent.

The ownership reorganisation for phase two of the Battersea Power Station Commercial Assets took a major step forward with the signing of a sale and purchase agreement last Friday between Battersea Phase 2 Holdco and PNB-Kwasa, Sime Darby Property and SP Setia said in a joint statement today.

SP Setia president and CEO Khor Chap Jen said the sale will bode well with the company’s business plan, as it aimed to play a major role in the project’s overall development.

“We would like to thank all the parties involved in evaluating this acquisition and making this transaction a success. The commitment shown by all demonstrates the confidence in this iconic London landmark development,” he added.

Meanwhile, Sime Darby Property group managing director Amrin Awaluddin said the deal was an important milestone in the development of the Battersea Power Station site, and was pleased to secure the commitment from two of Malaysia’s leading institutions.

The 17ha Battersea Power Station site is being developed over seven phases since 2012, managed by the London-based Battersea Power Station Development Company, on behalf of the shareholders.

Besides residential units, the retail and leisure spaces which were launched earlier this year gained strong interest from a wide-ranging collection of UK and other international brands.","__label__Neutral"
2721,"FReeper Canteen ~ Remembering Our Troops! ~ 18 October 2018","But he was pierced for our transgressions . . . and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5
The thorn pricked my index finger, drawing blood. I hollered and then groaned, drawing back my hand instinctively. But I shouldnt have been surprised: trying to prune a thorny bush without gardening gloves was a recipe for exactly what just happened.
The pain throbbing in my fingerand the blood flowing from itdemanded attention. And as I searched for a bandage, I found myself unexpectedly thinking about my Savior. After all, soldiers forced Jesus to don an entire crown of thorns (John 19:13). If one thorn hurt this much, I thought, how much agony would an entire crown of them inflict? And thats just a small portion of the physical pain He suffered. A whip flogged His back. Nails penetrated His wrists and ankles.
But Jesus endured spiritual pain too. Verse 5 of Isaiah 53 tells us, But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him. The peace Isaiah talks about here is another way of talking about forgiveness. Jesus allowed Himself to be piercedby nails, by a crown of thornsto bring us spiritual peace with God. His sacrifice, His willingness to die on our behalf, paved the way to make a relationship with the Father possible. And He did it, Scripture tells us, for me, for you.

Jesus allowed Himself to be pierced to bring us spiritual peace with God.
Isaiah 53:16 is part of a section of the book known as the Servant Songs. There are four Servant Songs in Isaiah that describe the service, suffering, and triumph of the servant of the LordJesus the Messiah. These songs are found in Isaiah 42:19, 49:113, 50:411, and 52:1353:12.
This last servant song describes the suffering and triumph of the servant. Though He is pierced, crushed, punished, and wounded, its His suffering that brings us peace and healing (53:5). The ultimate purpose for this suffering is outlined in verse 10His life is an offering for sin. The servant takes our placesuffering for us and bearing our sins. And by His suffering and death, we are given life and peace. But death is not the end for the servant: After he has suffered, he will see the light of life (v. 11). In His suffering and resurrection, Jesus reconciles humanity to God (see Matthew 8:17; Acts 8:3035; Romans 10:1517; 15:21).

328,"How climate change will affect the trees on your Chicago block: &#x27;It&#x92;s about to get a lot tougher.&#x27;","Chicago Tribune ^ | August 17, 2018  | by Cindy Dampier
When you think of climate change, you might be thinking melting glaciers, massive hurricanes or polar bears on dwindling ice floes. Add this to that grim list: The trees in your own backyard.
The birches in the corner of your kids favorite park, the towering spruce in your suburban backyard, that graceful linden on your block  all are likely to disappear from Chicagos landscape over the next few decades, casualties of a climate that is suddenly ill-suited to their needs.
Yet, at least one corner of Chicago should have a pretty good chance of retaining most of its trees in the face of worsening climate change, says entomologist and climate scientist Dan Herms.
There are a list of species that will be favored as the climate gets warmer and the precipitation patterns change, says Herms on a walk around the island with Chicago arborist Shawn Kingzette, and this is literally the list of those trees.
We all know Chicagos climate is tough  for our trees, its about to get a lot tougher.
Well have wet springs, more big storms in the summer, but not necessarily more precipitation, says Herms. More snow will be falling as rain. And it looks like the polar vortex will be a part of the change in climate. It will continue to be a factor for the Midwest and Northeastern United States.
In other words, says Kingzette, who also works for Davey Tree, You might be able to grow Southern varieties (of trees) here as the climate gets warmer, but they also had better be able to tolerate 20 below.","__label__Negative"
714,"AI and Data Management – Success Factor for data-driven enterprises","As part of the digital transformation, the success factor “information” is increasingly moving into to the center of attention for many business activities. This makes it more and more essential for companies to view information in the form of data as a valuable asset and treat it accordingly. The transformation to data-driven organizations requires a completely new alignment of existing business models.

On the other hand, a recent study conducted by SAP, in collaboration with the Economist Intelligent Unit on the Introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI), shows that the organizations that work the most with machine learning (ML) show on average 43% more growth than those who have not started using this new technology for themselves.

While artificial intelligence is now becoming the core of any business strategy, many companies are still struggling with the introduction of comprehensive data governance policies and the associated management of information. Leading organizations have discovered that the first step in making a successful journey to artificial intelligence is to improve their data management. Regardless of how intelligent algorithms may be, suboptimal training data will severely limit the effectiveness and later applicability of the generated rules. Transparency, quality, unambiguous master data, clear responsibilities and governance guidelines are crucial to the success of AI and ML. According to a survey by Accenture, 51% of the surveyed companies see the biggest obstacle to the lack of data quality. They also face difficulties with data- and cybersecurity, as well as the decision to evolve into artificial intelligence users or to work with appropriate partners.

Data management and machine learning should be considered as complementary building blocks. AI methods and algorithms help companies generate valuable insights from large amounts of data, such as can be used for a more target-group oriented customer interaction or for a more efficient equipment use.

At the same time, the question arises as to whether and, above all, how the value of the data can be quantified for the enterprise and what the most valuable information is for the respective organization. Every new technology requires new, more appropriate and sometimes better rules. Businesses need design principles that aim to gain high visibility into how AI is generating predictions. This allows a proactive approach to regulatory and ethical dilemmas which are often associated with the use of AI.

However, to ensure that the AI ​​does not remain an empty promise, companies need data of a very high quality. While in the traditional data analysis it is possible to locate and to remove suboptimal data and start all over again , this is not readily feasible with ML procedures, since from a certain level onward it becomes impossible to reproduce on which data elements the predictions are based. KI turns into a black box technology and “unlearning” almost impossible as the removal of a single element can cause the entire model to collapse. In analogy to the human brain, the entire complex of learned knowledge, which is based in part on false assumptions or information, loses its value and the process has to be completely re-established. Bad data records can definitely be identified in advance via faulty information, outliers, distorted value distributions, redundant information and poorly explained functions.

The SAP HANA Data Management Suite solutions can be used to set up efficient measures for the management of data along business processes and to generate added value from information through integrated processes, whereby KI and ML support the user efficiently, make work easier and significantly increase the quality of data entry. Concrete examples include algorithms that intelligently pre-populate fields, individual acquisition patterns of employees being learned, and voice input that will be supported by chatbots.","__label__Neutral"
1697,"New partnership formed to empower Pasifika student voice","The New Zealand Union of Students’ Associations (NZUSA) and New Zealand Tongan Tertiary Students’ Association (NZTTSA) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding expressing their joint commitment to uplifting the Pasifika student voice.

‘The tertiary student population is vast and diverse. If NZUSA is to genuinely represent the interests of all students, then we need to be as inclusive as possible,’ says NZUSA President Jonathan Gee. ‘NZTTSA’s voice in national level discussions is vital as the Pacific student population grows.’

‘NZTTSA is currently the only national organisation that exists to represent an ethnic Pacific student body,’ says NZTTSA President Mary Jane Kivalu. ‘As the Pacific enrolment numbers increase in several programmes and institutions, it is important that we speak up as users of the tertiary education system. Only we can speak to what works for us, so we can either make a change or be someone else’s change.’

Last year, NZUSA established the position of National Pasifika Liaison Officer in order to establish a network of Pasifika student leaders and to eventually work towards a national Pasifika student body. The role coincides with the development of an enhancement theme by the Academic Quality Agency, which brings university leaders (including students) together to improve access, opportunity and outcomes for Māori students and Pasifika students.

The MoU details how the relationship will be operationalised, which includes building greater Tongan and/or Pacific voice in national level discussions on student issues such as financial support and mental health. It also includes presenting at each others’ conferences, and working collaboratively on student campaigns.

NZUSA is the national voice of students in tertiary education. It represents the interests of students through research, campaigns and lobbying; and provides support to institution-based students' associations.

Teva Pharmaceuticals on Tuesday announced a nationwide recall of all amlodipine /valsartan combination tablets and all amlodipine/valsartan/ hydrochlorothiazide tablets due to a problem with the valsartan active ingredient manufactured in Mylan, India.

An impurity known as N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) was found in Mylan’s valsartan. NDEA has been found to possibly cause cancer in humans.

The impacted drugs are used to treat high blood pressure . Teva says no reports of illnesses have been reported.

Patients taking these drugs are urged to continue and to contact their pharmacist or doctor for alternatives.

The FDA in July announced the recall of five other valsartan products for NDEA contamination as well as possible contamination from a similar impurity, NDMA. Several more recalls were announced in August, while an irbesartan -based blood pressure drug was recalled earlier this month, along with another made with losartan .

All of the recalled products have ingredients manufactured in either China or India. The sudden rush of recalls because of ingredients made overseas has put more scrutiny on these foreign labs and on the FDA’s ability to effectively monitor their products for safety .

ETNews ( Translate ) reports that they have specifically provided samples to Apple and Google:
According to the industry on the 27th, Samsung Display made a set of foldable display and delivered it to Apple. This set, which is actually powered like a smartphone, has a 7.2-inch size foldable panel. 7.2 inches is 0.1 inches smaller than the Samsung Folder 'Galaxy Fold'.
Samsung has historically been both supplier and competitor to Apple and other smartphone manufacturers and provides the OLED screens for Apple's top of the line iPhones. According to the report, Samsung doesn't intend to keep foldable technology to itself and is instead working to dominate as a supplier for the technology. Samsung is said to be able to produced about 2.4 million units a year at this time but is considering moving up to 10 million units a year depending on demand.
Apple has been known to be working on foldable display technology for years with patents on the implementation of similar technology. While there are ongoing rumors that Apple has been testing such technologies in the lab, Apple has not been speculated to implement the technology until 2020 at the earliest .
Why should Apple compete in this stupid segment?
Why should Apple compete in this stupid segment?
Because a phone that unfolds into a tablet is valuable to me. I know some Apple sheep are dismissing it, but to me it’s innovative. Some things just need to be fine-tuned and improved.
Hardly. Makes sense as they supply the current OLED displays to Apple.
Why should Apple compete in this stupid segment?
I'm going to save this comment once Apple releases their foldable phone. I'm 100% certain that once Apple does something, you'll be changing your tune.
Cool, but people don't understand what the word means. That's the problem. Innovation is what changes your life in a meaningful way. Foldable display in a phone is simply not that. It's a cool feature of the phone.
No, Innovation does NOT require meaningful change to your life for it to be innovative. NOR does innovation require any measure of sales or adoption for it to exist.
All Innovation is, is a NEW method to accomplish a task in a unique or different way than methods that came before.
your attempt to call someone out for misusing a word while actually misusing the word your self was cute.
can I give you some advice. next time you post. research your post before you press reply.
They can't withhold something that Apple is not interested in at this time.
if Apple isn't interested, at least remotely, why are they trying out patents with it?
its' amazing how virtually all your posts have such inaccuracies that are Easily refuted. its like you're not even trying.
Now, wether they ever go forward is another take entirely. but clearly there's evidence apple has at least a passing interest in folding tech
How? Apple and other companies will be doing foldable screens, that’s the future.
How is foldable a future? Its gimmick at best. It may and will be useful for other products but iPhone will not be one of them. Why you may ask? Because of the very nature of the item. Even when phones had full keyboard and were openable to get more stuff it wasn't widely spread because it just wasn't so useful.
The samsung video shows exactly why this tech is not suitable for phones.
Little example - he takes it out the pocket, unfolds it and uses two hands now kinda. Is there a latch that locks the new state of the device or will I be responsible to hold it straight? Also, if there is a latch or mechanism to hold it in place then that is another step to think about. The bigger screen is not worth it and its not practical. It will be niche market and not just for the price. Future will take us in a different direction but foldable phones won't be one of it.","__label__Neutral"

The study of 6.9 million people found that the same conditions were recognized in men when they were about four years younger than the age at which women were diagnosed.

Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

For a wide range of diseases, diagnosis comes later in life for women than for men, according to a large Danish study.

Researchers don't know whether the later diagnoses are due to genetics, the environment, possible biases in the healthcare system - or some combination of reasons.

The study of health data from 6.9 million Danish people found that across hundreds of diseases, women on average were diagnosed when they were about four years older than the age at which the conditions were recognized in men.

""We're not just looking at one disease here, we're looking at all diseases and we are looking at an entire population, from cradle to grave,"" lead author Søren Brunak from the University of Copenhagen told Reuters Health by phone.

On average, women received cancer diagnoses 2.5 years after men. They received diagnoses for metabolic diseases like diabetes 4.5 years later.

""(This) actually surprised us quite a lot,"" Brunak said. ""Men generally have a tendency to get to the doctor later... So presumably the difference in onset is even larger.""

Brunak and his team considered incidence rates of diseases in the 18 broad categories of the ICD-10 diagnosis system managed by the World Health Organization.

The study wasn't designed to explain the causes of the differences. Another limitation is that researchers only looked at diagnoses made in hospitalized patients.

Dr. Noel Bairey Merz, director of the Barbra Streisand Women's Heart Center at the Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute, who was not involved in the study, pointed out to Reuters Health that the study therefore lacks information on age at diagnosis for people who didn't require hospitalization.

""On the other hand,"" she said, ""being hospitalized is a sign of a serious illness, so (that) adds significance to the diagnosis and supports that disease onset may be later in women.""

Brunak's study, published in Nature Communications, showed that the bone-thinning disease osteoporosis was a notable exception to the trend. Here, women were typically diagnosed before they suffered a fracture, while the opposite was true for men.

""I am fascinated by this study, which generally confirms all that I present in my Stanford course on Sex and Gender in Human Physiology and Disease,"" said Marcia Stefanick, Director of Stanford University's Women's Health and Sex Differences in Medicine Center.

""When men get diseases that most healthcare professionals consider 'women's diseases,' they are diagnosed at later, more serious stages, and vice versa,"" Stefanick, who was not involved with the study, told Reuters Health in an email.

""For example, women are diagnosed later for heart disease, not only because it is still largely considered a 'man's disease', but also because our diagnostic tests are male-biased, in terms in terms of 'typical' being the male presentation. All medical schools and healthcare training should emphasize both biological sex differences and gender biases so healthcare professionals are aware of unconscious biases.""

Bairey Merz agreed, adding that more research is needed to determine if the gender differences in age at diagnosis are ""real"" and whether they are linked to gender bias, actual biological sex differences or random error associations.","__label__Neutral"

Napier, 27 September 2018 – Cricket flour pancakes for breakfast? Sounds bizarre, but not so long ago, no-one had even heard of quinoa, kombucha or acai, and now these foods are commonplace in our café menus, supermarkets and homes.

Next month, food futurists, experts and innovators, together with Hawke’s Bay’s and New Zealand’s food industry will come together at the Future Foods Conference 2018 to discuss how the global future of food is changing, explore the food we might be eating in 20 years’ time and talk about the opportunities for New Zealand and Hawke’s Bay food producers.

Increasingly New Zealand is influenced by global food trends, says Business Hawke’s Bay CEO, Carolyn Neville.

“It’s essential that we understand the current trends, the factors shaping consumer choice and what that means for the global food industry.

“The future of food is changing faster than ever before, so it’s important for New Zealand and Hawke’s Bay producers to understand what the global food industry might look like in the future and the opportunities it presents.

leading experts about what’s happening and how they can add value to their business.

“Future Foods is a must-attend event,” says Mrs Neville.

Julia Jones, Farm Enterprise Specialist with KPMG says  the consumer (or end user of our product) needs to be at the heart of what we do.

“That means becoming consumer-based producers and ensuring when we go to market we capture the value of what New Zealand has to offer.

“Disruption tends be very obvious, yet in your face, opportunity will hide, so New Zealand’s food and fibre industry needs to be prepared to go hunting for opportunity and evolve to maintain relevance,“ says Ms Jones.

Peter Randrup, Director of edible insect company Anteater says that the future of protein will be insects, plants, algae, and lab-grown meat.

""In a survey of 250,000 people, 50% said they would eat insects instead of beef, if it helped the environment.

""Think of how much impact any current food group has on our food system - dairy, fungi, vegetables, seafood... the western world has just discovered another food group - insects. The impact this will have on our food system will be no less profound than the discovery of dairy,"" says Mr Randrup.

1121,"Our brains hurt trying to figure out Delta&#8217;s new eight-group boarding system","Delta Air Lines has a brand new “simple” way for passengers to board its planes and it will finally give travelers a chance to use the algebra they learned in middle school. Starting January 23, 2019, passengers on Delta will be divided into eight distinct boarding groups, requiring passengers to remember their aisle, seat, priority, cabin, and color scheme, the airline  announced today .
Groups one through three are for people who can pony up for premium classes, including first class, business, and premium economy (Delta Comfort +, the choice for thousandaires everywhere!). Group four will collect any remaining priority passengers, including silver medallion, credit card holders, and other Sky Priority types, while lowly passengers in the main cabin are spread out through groups five through seven. Basic Economy schlubs will be stuck in boarding group eight.
Believe it or not, this is all less complex than American Airlines, which has nine boarding zones, and United Airlines, which only boards with five zones but, after an  update to its boarding areas , now loads those five zones through two lanes (ugh, math).
According to Australia’s  ABC , passenger boarding delays cost U.S. airlines almost $40 billion each year, so it makes sense that they would want to speed it up while still making the high-paying customers feel special. (Delta’s chief marketing officer made a  statement  explaining that the new system is partially to give the people what they pay for. )
Despite the new-fangled boarding hokey-pokey, studies have shown that so-called block boarding (the method currently used) is actually the slowest way to board a plane. The fastest method, according to an astrophysicist named Jason Steffen, is a complex system of boarding based on alternating rows by seat type (window, aisle, middle). Steffen used an optimization algorithm and a computer simulation to devise the method and found that his scheme  cut passenger boarding time by three quarters , despite its complexity. In Steffen’s experiments, it took less than half the time of block boarding.
In effect, it’s hard to see how Delta’s new system will counter the boarding chaos.","__label__Neutral"

Between the jabs and the drama and a lot of dark flashbacks, there was one light moment, courtesy of Renata Klein. In the middle of the episode, we see Laura Dern’s character posing for a magazine cover shoot near the massive pool inside of her massive house in Monterey, California. The venture capitalist wears a very Wonder Woman–ish shiny red dress and gold belt, with her fists planted firmly at her waist. The 1979 song “It’s My House” by Diana Ross plays in the background as Klein jokingly remarks about how women often pose too delicately for a shoot that is supposed to highlight an empowered woman. Thus, her superwoman stance.
Discussing the Roland Mouret dress, La Perla bra, and Christian Louboutin shoes chosen for the scene, costume designer Alix Friedberg explains: “This was originally supposed to be a more traditional cover shoot for a typical power broker. We planned on a business suit for her, the cover-of-Forbes type of thing. Then, our director Andrea Arnold and Laura decided to turn it into something more. It was still a cover shoot for a business magazine, but they wanted something that spoke more to the idea of a woman in power, something that said that you can be sexy and powerful at the same time.” Friedberg also said that Dern was given no specific direction for the scene. “Andrea played some great tunes, started rolling the camera and Laura was left to do what Laura does best!” Friedberg also recalls that Dern “completely turned the scene on its head and we were all laughing so hard. She’s so brilliantly funny. And Renata, she’s just a fashion superhero.”","__label__Neutral"

Those days are over...Gaspar Orban is making a new name for himself as the leader of a Pentecostal church community, where he speaks in tongues, asserts that Jesus heals people through him during intensely emotional worship services and he proselytizes. Journalists of the 24.hu news site spent six weeks with Gáspár Orbán in his religious community. The journalists described one service as such:
Several people in the room fell to the floor. He raised a young girls arms to the sky, while smiling and even laughing quietly. From another corner of the room, you could hear occasional crying 
During one session, the young Mr. Orbán announced that God told him that there is someone in the room who suffered an accident while horseback riding, which is causing pain in the persons right knee. After a lengthy silence a girl got up and confirmed that she had, indeed, such an accident, but the pain was in her left knee.
The community went over to the young woman and prayed over her, with the community, known as Felház, declaring: Without signs, miracles and the expulsion of the devil, the Gospel is merely half there. Mr. Orbán emphasizes: it is not he or his peers who heal, but rather Jesus who is able to heal people through him.""

This is because, despite its best efforts, the company is consistently associated with teens’ penchant for vaping. And a new survey isn’t going to help this impression.
According to a study conducted by the University of Michigan–which has been happening on an annual basis since 1975–twice as many high schoolers used electronic cigarette devices this year compared to the year before. The survey, which queried 45,000 people, found that one in five high school seniors vaped nicotine at least once in the last month. This, writes the Associated Press, is an “unprecedented jump.”
This comes as companies like Juul try to clean up their act to avoid further scrutiny from regulators. The company has been accused of marketing to teens specifically, which it has denied. All the same, the numbers from this survey are sure to indicate that high schoolers are vaping nicotine more than ever before.
The silver lining of this study, however, is that teen use of other substances–like alcohol, cocaine, and heroine–has declined. So at least there’s that.","__label__Negative"

Judge Karina Martinez decided stricter rules recently imposed by the South American nation's embassy do not violate his asylum rights because authorities have the right to decide what is and is not allowed inside the building.

Ecuadorian officials praised the ruling in the latest row between the Australian hacker and the government that has provided him refuge for six years.

Relations between Mr Assange and Ecuador have grown increasingly prickly as the years have dragged on with no solution in sight.

Mr Assange's lawyer, Carlos Poveda, vowed to appeal against the decision.

Mr Assange argued the new measures, which also include requiring him to pay for his own medical bills and laundry services, are designed to coerce him into ending his asylum.

The rules also make clear that if Mr Assange does not properly feed and take care of his cat, the animal could be sent to the pound.

Ecuador's government contended the requirements are aimed at peaceful cohabitation in tight quarters in the small embassy, where Mr Assange takes up more than a third of the space.

Officials have complained that his soccer playing and skateboarding have damaged the building.

""It's clear this protocol was issued with strict respect for international law,"" Jose Valencia, Ecuador's foreign minister, said after the ruling.

Mr Assange took refuge in the embassy in 2012 as he tried to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced rape allegations.

A caregiver from Indonesia attends to a resident at a nursing care facility in Tenri, Nara Prefecture, in May 2017. | KYODO

The central government plans to ease language requirements for foreign technical interns in the nursing care sector as part of its efforts to bring in more laborers from abroad, government sources have said.

Japan opened up its nursing care sector to foreign nationals willing to work as trainees from November 2017. But the number of such trainees has seen sluggish growth apparently due to Japanese-language proficiency requirements, which have been set higher than those for interns in other sectors.

Currently, care workers must have either reached the N4 level on the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test before entering the country or pass N3 a year after they arrive. Those who fail the N3 test have to return to their home country.

But the government now plans to allow the workers to stay two additional years if they express their willingness to continuously study the language, the sources said Wednesday. The change in the system could go into effect in March, they said.

The move comes as Japan struggles with a labor crunch in the face of an aging population and falling birthrate. From April it will introduce a new visa system that will broaden the entry of foreign workers, including for the nursing care sector.

Japan introduced the technical intern program in 1993 with the stated goal of transferring skills to developing countries.

Having added the option of care workers to the intern program, the government had been expecting many applicants from countries such as Vietnam to engage in the job to assist the elderly in their daily activities, such as getting dressed or eating meals. But only about 250 were serving as care workers as of October last year.

Technical interns can stay up to five years. The system has been criticized as a cover for companies that want to import cheap labor.

Those who have gone through the existing technical intern program for more than three years will be able to obtain a new visa status to be created from April, and the government expects many interns to apply.

The introduction of the new visa system represents a major shift for the country, which had effectively granted working visas only to people with professional knowledge and high skills, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers.

In line with the new visa policy, the government is planning to strengthen regulations on brokers who collect large sums from foreign nationals seeking to work in Japan.

According to a draft plan compiled by the labor ministry last month, the government aims to enhance the protection of foreign workers from April by introducing tougher standards for Japanese placement agencies working with brokers overseas.

Foreign workers who arrive as trainees under the technical intern program often bear heavy debts as brokers collect a large amount of money from the workers or their families under the pretext of guarantee deposits or other fees.","__label__Neutral"
1834,"Kris Johnson, Seiya Suzuki lead way as Carp silence Hawks in Game 2 of Japan Series","HIROSHIMA – This time there was a winner.

Kris Johnson, Seiya Suzuki and the rest of the Hiroshima Carp made sure of it.

Johnson delivered a strong performance on the mound, Suzuki had three hits and drove in three runs and the Carp struck first in this Japan Series with a 5-1 win in Game 2 in front of a crowd of 31,356 on Sunday night at Mazda Stadium.

“(Johnson) really did a great job and gave us the chance to win,” Carp manager Koichi Ogata said. “Also, it was big for us to get on the scoreboard first. (Kosuke) Tanaka, Seiya (Suzuki) and (Ryuhei) Matsuyama all did a great job.”

Hiroshima’s victory comes a day after the teams played out a 2-2 tie in Game 1 and gives the Central League champions a 1-0 lead in the series.

“I was exhausted,” Suzuki said of Saturday’s 12-inning tie, which lasted 4 hours and 38 minutes. “So we tried to play faster and it felt good to do it.”

Game 3 is Tuesday night in Fukuoka.

“We’ll be the visitors, but we’ll try not to be overwhelmed by the atmosphere and just play our game,” Suzuki said.

Johnson carved through the Hawks in order over the first three innings, yielding his first baserunner on a walk to Keizo Kawashima to start the fourth. After allowing a single to the next batter, Kenta Imamiya, and an error by Yoshihiro Maru in the outfield, Johnson was left with runners on the corners and no outs.

He went on to retire the next 10 Hawks in order.

“That’s the time you really need to make your pitches,” Johnson said of the fourth. “Knuckle down, as we say, really execute all your pitches.”

Johnson threw seven innings of one-run ball in the win, allowing four hits and striking out seven.

“I struggled a little bit early trying to locate away to righties, but once I settled that down, everything was thrown for strikes for the most part,” Johnson said. “It was just a good overall mix.”

Including his final start of the regular season and a turn in the CL Climax Series Final Stage, Johnson has allowed two runs in his last 22 innings.

Suzuki continued to deliver at the plate for Hiroshima, finishing 3-for-4 after picking up a pair of hits in Game 1. He drove in the team’s first run with an infield single in the first and singled in two more in the fifth.

“He has a great fastball, so I tried to not swing too hard and stay compact and was just thinking about getting on base to set the table to the others,” he said of facing Hawks starter Rick van den Hurk. “I’ve had some good at-bats since the series began, but I want to reset and hopefully I can make good adjustments.”

Maru and Matsuyama also drove in runs for Hiroshima.

Nobuhiro Matsuda accounted for Softbank’s only run with a single in the seventh. The Hawks finished with four singles and were held without an extra-base hit for the second straight night.

SoftBank starter Rick van den Hurk was charged with the loss after allowing five runs — three earned — on eight hits over five innings. He struck out seven.

“Van den Hurk and I go way back,” Johnson said. The pitchers were both in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization in 2012. “We actually played as teammates a ways back. He’s a great pitcher.

“I definitely had the mindset of coming into a pitcher’s duel. We’ve pitched against him before. All I can say is he’s a great pitcher. We just got to him this time.”

Tanaka began Van den Hurk’s troubles in the first with a double to left that got past Alfredo Despaigne. Tanaka then advanced on Ryosuke Kikuchi’s sacrifice bunt. Maru went down swinging, but Suzuki hit a bouncing ball up the middle and beat shortstop Imamiya’s throw to first as a run scored.

Tanaka began the third with a single, and a throwing error by second baseman Kawashima, on a ball hit by Kikuchi, left the Carp with runners on second and third. Maru hit a fly ball into foul territory in left and Tanaka tagged up to score when Despaigne caught the ball. Matsuyama later added to the lead with a two-out RBI single to make it 3-0.

Kawashima walked to begin the SoftBank half of the fourth. Imamiya followed with a single and Kawashima advanced to third when Maru mishandled the ball in center field on the same play.

Johnson responded by getting Yurisbel Gracial to line out to the shortstop, striking out Yuki Yanagita and retiring Despaigne on a ground ball to end the inning.

“He got out of it in the best way possible,” catcher Yoshiyuki Ishihara said.

Yanagita and Despaigne hit consecutive one-out singles in the seventh and Matsuda later sent a ball up the middle for an RBI single. Takuya Kai nearly did more damage with a grounder to right, but a diving stop by Matsuyama at first base helped end the inning.

GOP winning the Senate means the dimwit American people can watch their duly elected President Trump be impeached, harassed,undermined and framed by the Pelosi and Maxine run House which will be Dem.
Are they that corrupt and stupid? Yes, I guess so. To vote for the people who scream at Senate hearings and who shove a Senator and his wife in a restaurant and threaten to kill our President? Some America that is.
If that’s what the evil American people want, then they’ll get the countermeasures they’ve been goading us to.

Not a fan of RCP’s averaging polls, but a +4 gain feels right. I think the GOP will lose the House though...
RCP - don’t they take averages of polls? - meaning they’re always about at least a week or two behind the curve because it takes a couple of weeks to build a group to sample - when trends start to shift getting closer to election day, they’re going to be left in the dust......
Need 55 to govern. The Lib twins and Romney only have to convince Rand which gives him too much power. You always need to be able to lose those 4. Technically Pence can always be the deciding vote so maybe that would work but 55 is a very solid majority even with a few never Trumpers. 55+ the House means you better get something done or you’re going to lose big in 2020. You can’t always get what you want but you just may get what you need...
I agree with your prediction. Im sticking with +5

If your pet goes outside at all, they need flea and tick prevention year-round. It is even more important during the warmer months.

Which is much easier than wrangling your pet every 30 days and trying to put a little bit of goo between their shoulder blades.

2069,"SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA","In this blog some commonly asked questions will be addressed:

Where is SAP Credit Management information displayed in S/4HANA?

What is included in the base license of SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA?

How are some of the new features of SAP Credit Management Configured?

What is the minimum configuration required for SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA?

This graphic presents a good overview of the features of Credit Management in S/4HANA from a functional standpoint. The features of Credit Limit Management, Credit Rules Engine and Credit Information are explored in this blog. The features of Documented Credit Decisions, the follow on process engine and Credit Limit requests via Credit Cases will be addressed in my next blog. A blog written by a RIG colleague shows an overview of functionality in more detail and can be linked to here .

Where is Credit Management Information displayed in S/4HANA?

The Business Partner displays where the Credit Management data is stored. In the BP Role of “SAP Credit Management” the Scoring Rules, Risk Class, Check Rule and the integration to External Credit Agencies are all listed. This can be accessed via the GUI t/code “BP” (refer to the Credit Profile and Creditworthiness tabs) or in Fiori by the “Manage Business Partner” app. Here is an example of the BP t/code:

What is Included in the Base License of SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA?

The base license includes the manual features for setting credit limits, setting risk classes and setting an internal score for a Business Partner. If an automated calculation is needed, then an additional license is required.

For the link to an external credit agency, an xml formatted file can be added as project work or the data can be input manually on the Business Partner as a part of the base license. An additional license is required to use the cloud-based link to credit agencies. The cloud-based service provides about 20-30 credit agencies such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet right out of the box.

How are some of the new features of SAP Credit Management Configured?

Credit Limits are referenced in the Sales Order Process. A Sales Order will be put on hold if the Credit Limit is exceeded. The first step in setting a Credit Limit is to define a formula the IMG under FSCM &gt; Credit Management &gt; Master Data &gt; Define Formula. Formulas are set up using the attributes of the Business Partner and standard functions. The Formula set up looks like a “calculator” similar to the way FI validations and substitutions are configured. A BADI can also be used to augment the content delivered by SAP. Credit Management data such as what is stored on the Creditworthiness tab (for example, Credit Standing, Status, Rating, etc.) can be used in the Formula. The Formula is then linked to the Credit Limit in the IMG under FSCM &gt; Credit Management &gt; Master Data &gt; Create Rule for Scoring and Credit Limit Calculation.

Create Rule for Scoring and Credit Limit Calculation example:

Risk Classes can be used to set a credit limit or to make a decision to release blocked sales orders in the Credit Case. The Risk Class can be manually input on a Business Partner or it can be calculated based on the Credit Rating of a Business Partner. The Risk Classes are defined in the IMG under FSCM &gt; Credit Management &gt; Master Data &gt; Create Risk Classes.

Scores can be used to set a credit limit or to make a decision to release blocked sales orders in the Credit Case. Usually an internal score is used mainly to derive a Risk Class. Similar to Setting the Credit Limit, the first step in setting an internal score is to define a formula the IMG under FSCM &gt; Credit Management &gt; Master Data &gt; Define Formula. The Formula is linked to the Internal Score in the IMG under FSCM &gt; Credit Management &gt; Master Data &gt; Create Rule for Scoring and Credit Limit Calculation. Any of the attributes in the Creditworthiness tab can be used to Score a Business Partner.

In the Business Partner on the Credit Profile tab, an xml file containing credit data can be linked. The URL and the RFC to the cloud-based tool are created in the config step: In the IMG under FSCM &gt; Credit Management &gt; Master Data &gt; Integration of External Credit Agencies or FSCM &gt; Credit Management &gt; Current Settings &gt; Integration of External Credit Agencies

What is the Minimum Configuration Required for SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA?

Following the “Principle of One“ where there was overlapping functionality across applications, the S/4HANA solution is simplified to one. At its core, SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA is for all intents and purposes FSCM which was rebranded in S/4HANA. The former AR and SD features were then added. SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA resides in the Finance Module. For the minimum configuration of SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA, perform the “required” actions in the Task List PDF attached to the SAP Note 2270544 .

For a conversion to S/4HANA, complete the prerequisites for the migration to SAP Credit Management:

Complete all documents related to payment guarantee Letter of Credit.

Eliminate the usage of SAP objects in your own code. For details on how to adapt user-defined customer code that relies on the changed objects, see the SAP Notes 2227014 (Financials) and 2217124 (SD)

This blog addressed some common questions surrounding Credit Management Functionality in S/4HANA. Future blogs will address Fiori apps and reports and Credit Cases managed via Documented Credit Decisions for SAP Credit Management in S/4HANA. Let me know what you think of this blog or if you have ideas for other blogs that are needed.","__label__Neutral"
2429,"Explosion on Jupiter-sized star 10 times more powerful than ever seen on the sun","A stellar flare ten times more powerful than anything seen on our sun has burst from an ultracool star almost the same size as Jupiter.
The star is the coolest and smallest to give off a rare white-light superflare, and by some definitions could be too small be considered a star.
The discovery, funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council, is published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society: Letters as the version of record today (17 April) and sheds light on the question of how small a star can be and still display flaring activity in its atmosphere. Flares are thought to be driven by a sudden release of magnetic energy generated in the star’s interior. This causes charged particles to heat plasma on the stellar surface, releasing vast amounts of optical, UV and X-ray radiation.
Lead author James Jackman, a Ph.D. student in the University of Warwick’s Department of Physics, said: “The activity of low mass stars decreases as you go to lower and lower masses and we expect the chromosphere (a region of the star which support flares) to get cooler or weaker. The fact that we’ve observed this incredibly low mass star, where the chromosphere should be almost at its weakest, but we have a white-light flare occurring shows that strong magnetic activity can still persist down to this level.
“It’s right on the boundary between being a star and a brown dwarf, a very low mass, substellar object. Any lower in mass and it would definitely be a brown dwarf. By pushing this boundary we can see whether these type of flares are limited to stars and if so, when does this activity stop? This result takes us a long way to answering these questions.”
The L dwarf star located 250 light years away, named ULAS J224940.13-011236.9, is only a tenth of the radius of our own sun, almost the same size as Jupiter in our solar system. It was too faint for most telescopes to observe until the researchers, led by the University of Warwick, spotted the massive stellar explosion in its chromosphere in an optical survey of the surrounding stars.
Using the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS) facility at the European Southern Observatory’s Paranal Observatory, with additional data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), they observed the brightness of the star over 146 nights.
The flare occurred on the night of 13 August 2017 and gave off energy equivalent to 80 billion megatonnes of TNT, ten times as much energy as the Carrington event in 1859, the highest energy event observed on our sun. Solar flares occur on our Sun on a regular basis, but if the Sun were to superflare like this star the Earth’s communications and energy systems could be at serious risk of failing.
It is one of the largest flares ever seen on an L dwarf star, making the star appear 10,000 times brighter than normal.
James adds: “We knew from other surveys that this kind of star was there and we knew from previous work that these kinds of stars can show incredible flares. However, the quiescent star was too faint for our telescopes to see normally – we wouldn’t receive enough light for the star to appear above the background from the sky. Only when it flared did it become bright enough for us to detect it with our telescopes.”
James’s Ph.D. supervisor Professor Peter Wheatley said: “Our twelve NGTS telescopes are normally used to search for planets around bright stars, so it is exciting to find that we can also use them to find giant explosions on tiny, faint stars. It is particularly pleasing that detecting these flares may help us to understand the origin of life on planets.”
L dwarfs are among the lowest mass objects that could still be considered to be a star, lying in the transition region between stars and brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are not massive enough to fuse hydrogen into helium as stars do. L dwarfs are also very cool compared to the more common main sequence stars, such as red dwarfs, and emit radiation mostly in the infra-red, which may affect their ability to support the creation of life.
James adds: “Hotter stars will emit more in the optical spectrum, especially towards the UV. Because this star is cooler, around 2000 kelvin, and most of its light is towards the infra-red, when it flares you get a burst of UV radiation that you wouldn’t normally see.
“To get chemical reactions going on any orbiting planets and to form amino acids that form the basis of life, you would need a certain level of UV radiation. These stars don’t normally have that because they emit mostly in the infra-red. But if they produced a large flare such as this one that might kickstart some reactions.”
Professor Wheatley adds: “It is amazing that such a puny star can produce such a powerful explosion. This discovery is going to force us to think again about how small stars can store energy in magnetic fields. We are now searching giant flares from other tiny stars and push the limits on our understanding of stellar activity.”","__label__Neutral"
2348,"Gun Control Group Gets a New Disguise","The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the U.S.’s oldest gun control lobby, has changed its name to  Brady  as part of its rebranding efforts.

The gun control advocacy group announced this new rebranding strategy at an event celebrating the 25th anniversary of the  Brady bill , which laid the first step to creating a federal gun registry.

Reliable gun control advocates such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were in attendance at the event.

Brady’s rebranding strategy coincides with the Democratic-controlled House’s move to vote Wednesday on  universal gun registration for all firearms purchases.

With Democrats in control, this would be the first gun control bill to be voted out of at least one chamber of Congress since the Clinton era.

Brady traces its origins back to the National Council to Control Handguns, which was established in 1974 as the first prominent gun control group in America. The group was named after Jim and Sarah Brady. Jim Brady was President Ronald Reagan’s press secretary who was shot during an assassination attempt on the president. This failed assassination attempt left Brady paralyzed, which helped galvanize support for his gun control efforts.

In 2001, the group would later be renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.

The Brady Campaign’s latest decision to rebrand is part of the gun controller’s strategy to confuse the public with ambiguous rhetoric and labeling. “Gun safety”, “commonsense gun control”, and “red flag” laws are just the many terms used by gun controllers to conceal their true intentions—gun confiscation.

Deception is the norm in politics, and when busybody politicians change the language in political debates, they can manipulate public opinion in their favor and make the public receptive to the idea of liberty-crushing legislation.

Despite hand-wringing from gun control groups like Brady, crimes rates  plummeted from 1993 to 2013, a period when per capita gun ownership increased by 56 percent.

These facts don’t matter to Brady, who continues to deceive the public and move their gun control agenda forward. Brady’s brand might be new, but their tactics and endgame remain the same.","__label__Negative"
420,"Surprise! Get Ready For JPMorgan Coin (UPDATED 2) - Cryptonews","On Valentine's day, major investment bank JPMorgan showed some love to cryptocurrencies. Well, sort of. (Updates throughout the entire text.)
In a few months, the banking giant with a USD 2.6 trillion balance sheet, plans to start trials of JPM Coin, the centralized digital token created by the financial giant to instantly settle payments between institutional clients.
""We successfully tested the movement of money between a client account and a JPMorgan account using the new technology,"" Umar Farooq, head of Digital Treasury Services and Blockchain at the bank, explained in a presentation , shared by JPMorgan.
""The JPM Coin isn’t money per se. It is a digital coin representing United States Dollars held in designated accounts at JPMorgan Chase N.A. In short, a JPM Coin always has a value equivalent to one US dollar. When one client sends money to another over the blockchain, JPM Coins are transferred and instantaneously redeemed for the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, reducing the typical settlement time,"" Farooq added.
He also claims that over time, JPM Coin will be extended to other major currencies.
According to Farooq, JPM Coin is currently a prototype that will be tested with a small number of institutional clients, with plans to expand the pilot program later this year.
""JPM Coin is currently designed for business-to-business money movement flows, and because we are still in a testing phase, we don’t have plans to make this available to individuals at this stage. That said, the cost-savings and efficiency benefits would extend to the end customers of our institutional clients,"" he said. Moreover, the bank ""will actively engage our regulators to explain its design and solicit their feedback and any necessary approvals.""
Earlier today, Farooq told CNBC that there are three early applications for the JPM Coin:
International payments for large corporate clients, which now typically happens using wire transfers between financial institutions on decades-old networks like Swift.
The final use for JPM Coin would be for huge corporations who use JPMorgan's treasury services business to replace the dollars they hold in subsidiaries across the world.
The head of Digital Treasury Services and Blockchain estimates that the coin could also be used for payments on internet-connected devices if that use for blockchain catches on.
The JPM Coin will be issued on Quorum blockchain and subsequently extended to other platforms.
How does JPM Coin work?
“JPMorgan is taking a significant step here,"" Adam Grimsley, a former BlackRock Inc. fixed-income investor who co-founded London-based crypto hedge fund Prime Factor Capital, told Bloomberg. “The first bullet in any war is always the most important, and it looks like this could be the first move in a broader adoption of blockchain and digital currencies by large institutions.”
And now they also believe that ""JPM Coin can yield significant benefits for blockchain applications by reducing clients’ counterparty and settlement risk, decreasing capital requirements and enabling instant value transfer.""
However, as it's well-known, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, has infamously called Bitcoin “a fraud” during an appearance at an event hosted by Barclays in September 2017. Dimon later added that the cryptocurrency “will blow up.” It was also during that appearance that said that he would terminate any trader that he found to be trading Bitcoin for being “stupid.” However, he has later said that he regretted what he said, but added that he is still not a fan.
JPMorgan has previously expressed interest in both cryptocurrencies and blockchain, the underlying technology. Perhaps most notable is Quorum, the enterprise-oriented blockchain platform based on Ethereum .
The bank is also running a blockchain payments trial, based on Quorum and launched in conjunction with Australia’s ANZ and the Royal Bank of Canada. The project, called the Interbank Information Network (IIN), was set up in October 2017, aiming to slash both the time and costs required for interbank payments using traditional methods.
The company was initially said to look favorably upon cryptocurrencies according to a leaked internal report from February 2018, which was reported to say, “Cryptocurrencies are the face of blockchain,” along with “cryptocurrencies are here to stay.” However, it would seem that the giant had perhaps not meant the existing cryptocurrencies, as a note to investors from around the same time alleged that Bitcoin was unequipped to handle a liquidity crisis.
Then, in April last year, a credit card customer of JPMorgan said he was suing the bank for slapping what he labels “sky-high” interest rates and fees on the bills of cryptocurrency investors. Brady Tucker, of Idaho in the United States, said the credit card provider began charging him interest rates of as much as 30% per year – as well as additional fees – on cryptocurrency purchases made through cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase exchange in January last year.
Most recently, at the end of last month, the bank stated in a report on crypto and blockchain that, “Even in extreme scenarios such as a recession or financial crises, there are more liquid and less-complicated instruments for transacting, investing and hedging,” as previously reported . The usage of cryptocurrencies for payments will remain “challenged,” they said, adding that they couldn’t find any major retailers accepting crypto in the past year.
All of this seems to indicate that, although the bank recognizes the merits of cryptocurrencies, they do not consider any coin but their own ready for widespread adoption.
However, the biggest question following the news of JPM Coin is whether the banking giant was considering working with Ripple , California-based blockchain start-up focusing on the banking sector, instead of creating own coin. Although the bank did not comment on that, they seem unbothered by the fact that Ripple exists in the same space. JPMorgan is betting that its first-mover status and large market share in corporate payments, as it banks a large number of companies, will give its technology a good chance of getting adopted, even if other banks create their own coins. ""Pretty much every big corporation is our client, and most of the major banks in the world are, too,"" Farooq said. ""Even if this was limited to JPM clients at the institutional level, it shouldn't hold us back.""
Did anyone expect them to go from dollars to bitcoin? Gotta experiment.

1979,"Are Prince Harry & Meghan Markle Moving To Africa? This Reported Update Is Unexpected","Are Prince Harry &amp; Meghan Markle Moving To Africa? This Reported Update Is Unexpected

We know the continent has always held a special place in their hearts, but are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle moving to Africa ? It sounds totally out of left field, I know. But there's reportedly a chance the couple might actually be moving there in the near future.

Yes, they literally just made the move to Frogmore Cottage and, yes, they reportedly spent around £3 million renovating their new home, but they reportedly might be relocating soon. According to the Daily Mail, Meghan and Harry are possibly going to move to an entirely new country in order to fulfill "" a role that involves the Commonwealth , charity work and promoting Britain."" (Elite Daily has reached out to reps for the couple and did not hear back in time for publication.)

The location for this mysterious new role reportedly still hasn't been chosen and it's ""unlikely to be decided until next year."" That being said, Cosmopolitan reports that people are guessing that Harry and Meghan are going to wind up in Africa .

The two have been super open about their shared love for the continent since they first announced their engagement. They famously took a trip there together back in 2017 for Meghan's 36th birthday. ""I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars,"" he told reporters of the romantic trip during a photo call at Kensington Gardens . ""Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to get to know each other.""

The pair even shared some pictures from their trip on their shared Instagram page last month:

In addition to camping under the stars there, Harry also does a lot of social justice work in the continent. Cosmopolitan reports that Harry is currently the president of the African Parks Network nonprofit and also spent an entire year in the Lesotho back in 2004.

While the location is still to be determined, deets on what the actual role will reportedly entail are a little more clear. According to the Daily Mail, the role will likely be taking advantage of Meghan and Harry's worldwide mega fame to bring attention to various causes. Honestly, if this is true, mad respect to both of them for really using their fame to raise awareness for causes that actually matter!

The move also reportedly wouldn't be permanent. According to the Daily Mail, the two would only have to be away from their chic new cottage for two or three years. So, basically, a year for each million they reportedly spent on renovating their new home! Relatable.

Regarding the alleged future move, a spokesperson for the royal family told Cosmopolitan that ""any future plans for The Duke and Duchess are speculative at this stage. No decisions have been taken about future roles."" This vague response obviously has us wondering whether or not the move will actually happen. The spokesperson didn't deny it, so it just might. But they didn't confirm either so, like, who knows?!

No matter where they wind up living, here's to hoping that Harry, Meghan, and their baby live a happy, healthy life together.","__label__Positive"
704,"HEALTH – “STRANGE DAYS (1999)”","Chris DeVille @chrisdeville | January 18, 2019 - 9:30 am

Share &lt; br /&gt;this article:

HEALTH have been busy lately. The LA electronic noise-rockers released a smattering of collaborative singles last fall with a wide range of artists including Soccer Mommy and Purity Ring , Perturbator , and Youth Code . And in December, they announced their new album VOL 4: SLAVES OF FEAR and shared its title track .

Today they return with another punishing track called “STRANGE DAYS (1999).” Brutally heavy industrial sections give way to eerie melodic passages in which a detached androgynous voice repeats the phrase, “Strange days, slowing down.” As the song progresses, the various layers pile up to a harshly percolating wave of noise, capped off by the ominous question: “Where will you be when they come?” It’ll leave you haunted and quite possibly flattened.","__label__Neutral"
